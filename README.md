# Project Readme

Hi, I'm Tobi, and welcome to the Doo-Hickey repository.

This project was created in response to a technical interview task assigned to me by CJID. The total build time for this project was 12 hours and 31 minutes. For a demonstration, you can check out this [demo video](https://vimeo.com/896159556/3ace706210).

The primary goal behind Doo-Hickey was to develop a platform capable of extracting text from documents, particularly newspapers. The extracted text is stored in a database, categorized by title and content. This extracted data serves as a resource for training a machine learning model. The aim is to create human-like conversations with the data, allowing users to query the model in natural language and receive human-based responses, utilizing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Now, let's dive into setting up Doo-Hickey on your machine.

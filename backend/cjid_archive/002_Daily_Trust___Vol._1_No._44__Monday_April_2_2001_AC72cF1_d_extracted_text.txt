New population policy
| pegs marriage for
girls at 18

new population
policy may outlaw
marriages for girls

below the age of 18 years in
the country.

The new policy now
being scrutinised by the
National Assembly is aimed
at curbing pregnancy-related
deaths and diseases as well
as infant deaths and ailments

associated with early
marriages.

The draft policy is
seeking appropriate

legislation to discourage
harmful traditional practices,
especially early marriages
and violence against women.

The draft is proposing
that age at first marriage for
women should be at least 18
years while men should be
required to lawfully
acknowledge and register
marriages with appropriate
authorities.

A copy of the draft which
was made available to the
News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN) notes that
complications related to
pregnancies and child-birth
are among the leading
causes of mortality and
morbidity of women of child-
bearing age.

Early marriages for girls
can make them develop
Vesico-Verginal Fistula,
(VVF) an abnormal
complication after child
delivery leading to the
leakage of urine and faeces
from the vigina.

“Measures to prevent,
detect and manage high risk
pregnancies and births,
particularly to women below
18 years shall be promoted,”
the draft says.

It notes that while
adolescents (ages 10-19)
comprise 23 per cent of the
population, young adults
(ages 20-24) account for 32
per cent while high fertility
has contributed to such age
structure.

“This implies that a large
proportion of development
resources need to go to meet
the education, health,

housing, food and the

ran has summoned the

ambassador of the United

- Arab Emirates to the for-

eign ministry this week to

protest over three disputed
islands in the Persian Gulf.

The envoy was told of
Tehran’s objection to Abu
Dhabi’s continued claim on
the islands of Abu Musa and
the Greater and Lesser
Tunbs.

A spokesman for the Ira-
nian foreign ministry said the
islands were an inseparable
part of Iran.

“The islands have always
been Iranian and will always
be an integral part of Iranian
territory and sovereignty,”
the spokesman, Hamid-Reza
Asefi said.

But he said Iran remained
ready to hold unconditional
talks with the UAE to remove
misunderstanding.

Earlier in March the
UAE’s foreign ministry sum-
moned the Iranian ambassa-
dor to protest over a visit to
the islands by Iranian parlia-
mentarians and over what it
said were plans to settle Ira-
nians on the islands.

The islands, which oc-
cupy a strategically important
position at the mouth of the
Gulf, were occupied by Iran
in 1971 after Britain withdrew
its forces from the region.

Zimbabwean groups press for new constitution

undreds of cam-
paigners have at
tended a confer-

ence in the Zimbabwean capi-
tal, Harare, to press for anew
national constitution.

The one-day meeting -
organised by a broad coali-
tion of civic groups, the Na-
tional Constitutional Assem-
bly (NCA) - was boycotted
by the government, war vet-
erans and President Robert
Mugabe’s governing ZANU-

gyptian President
Hosni Mubarak has
criticised the new

American policy in the
Middle East in an interview
timed with his arrival in Wash-
ington to meet President
George W Bush.

The comments fore-
shadow what are expected to
be some robust exchanges at
the White House between
the new US administration
and one of his firmest Arab
allies.

Mr Bush has repeatedly
stated that his administration
will not “force peace” in the
Middle East, signalling a de-
parture from the aggressive
pursuit of a peace deal be-
tween Israel and the Pales-
tinians undertaken by his
predecessor, Bill Clinton.

“It requires two willing
parties to come to the table
to enact a peace treaty that
will last,’ Mr Bush said on
Thursday. “And this admin-
istration won’t try to force
peace on the parties.”

But as Mr Mubarak’s
plane touched down at
Andrews Air Force Base,
Newsweek magazine released

an interview in which the it

Mubarak attacks US Mid-East policy

Egyptian leader chastised the
US administration for taking
a hands-off approach.

“The new administration
may not have a picture of
what’s going on,” Mr
Mubarak told the US weekly,
which made an advance copy
of its interview, on sale from
Monday, available to the me-
dia on Saturday.

“I’m going to tell them
what I feel,” he added.

Mr Mubarak went on to
say that the United States
“cannot just take its hands
off” the situation in the
Middle East amid escalating
violence.

“It has to work to narrow
the gap between the Palestin-
ians and the Israelis,” he
pointed out.

The Egyptian president
also criticised America’s de-
cision to veto a UN Security
Council resolution calling for
deployment of UN observers
in the West Bank and Gaza.

“I sent the United States
a message: ‘Please don’t veto
now,” “ Mr Mubarak said.
“They did, and the Arab del-
egations changed resolu-
tions. We couldn’t prevent

PF party.

In the lead up to the con-
ference, ZANU-PF took out
full-page newspaper adver-
tisements, saying the NCA
had no national mandate to

press for reforms.

Last year, the president
proposed a new constitution
which would have increased
his powers.

It was rejected after a
successful campaign by the
NCA.

President Mugabe has
tried to discredit the NCA,
which has undertaken its
own consultation exercise
with the people to produce a
new draft.

Newspaper advertise-
ments accused NCA mem-
bers of taking money from Mr
Mugabe’s western critics
and the main opposition
Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC) to undermine
his government.

“Say ‘NO’, don’t be used
by the MDC/NCA/donor al-
liances ever again,” said one
of the ads.

But the chairman of
Saturday’s gathering - uni-
versity lecturer John
Makumbe - told delegates
Zimbabweans must have a
constitution acceptable to
the majority.

Somali gunmen
free UN hostages

omali gunmen have re

S leased another two of

the United Nations aid

workers they kidnapped on
Tuesday.

The two are Belgian
Pierre-Paul Lamotte and
Frenchman Mohamed
Mohamedi. Two Bnitons, Bill
Condie from Scotland and
Roger Carter, are still being
held.

Ten people were ab-
ducted when gunmen loyal
to warlord Musa Sudi
Yalahow attacked the
Mogadishu offices of the
humanitarian organisation,
Medicins sans Frontieres.

Five other foreign aid
workers and a Somali na-
tional were set free on
Wednesday morning.

The latest release follows
UN negotiations with Musa
Sudi Yalahow and the inter-
vention of community lead-
ers in Mogadishu.

“The hostages are free to
leave Mogadishu uncondi-

tionally... and fly from Gezira
airport to Nairobi,” said a
spokesman for Musa Sudi
Yalahow.

“They were released on
humanitarian grounds. No
money was paid, or de-
manded.”

On the two Bntons who
remain in captivity, the
spokesman said: “They are
in good hands and | expect
their release today.”

UN spokeswoman Sonya
Lawrence Green said: “Dis-
cussions continue between
UN and Somali groups to se-
cure their immediate release.”

On Thursday, the UN Se-
curity Council demanded
that all four UN workers
should be freed and their ab-
ductors brought to justice.

Foreign aid workers have
been targeted in Mogadishu
by gunmen who see them as
a lucrative source of foreign
currency.

MSF says it has now sus-
pended operations in the
Somali capifal.

he Dalai Lama has
provoked China as
he discussed the

touchy issue of Taiwanese
independence and Tibet’s
relations with Beijing at the
start of his 10-day trip to
Taiwan. *

Sipping tea and laughing
during an hour-long news
conference, over the week-
end, the Tibetan spiritual
leader said that China’s sus-
picions about his second visit
to Taiwan were wrong.

He did not come to plot
with Taiwanese about how to
split up China, he said.

“I want someone from
Beijing to come while I’m here

and watch my movements
here and investigate whether
I’m involved in anti-Chinese
activities,” the Nobel Peace
Prize winner said.

The trip, which is being
described as a religious one,
includes a series of lectures
on Buddhism and spiritual-
ity.

But the Dalai Lama also
plans to meet new President
Chen Shui-bian and the
island’s former leader, Lee
Teng-hui - a move that has
infuriated Beijing.

The Dalai Lama praised
Mr Chen for “wisely” and
“realistically” handling rela-
tions with China since his

he British general
election has been
postponed from May

to June, this year.

Prime Minister Tony Blair
made the decision at his coun-
try residence Chequers after
coming under pressure from
leaders of other parties and
from within the Cabinet to
concentrate on fighting the
foot-and-mouth crisis.

An official announce-
ment will be made today.

The BBC’s political editor
Andrew Marr said that call-
ing an election campaign on
3 May would have been dif-
ficult for Mr Blair, so soon
after taking personal charge
of the fight against the epi-
demic.

He said: “Now Mr Blair
can appear to be magnani-
mous and appear to be
strong.”

County council elections
had been scheduled for 3
May, with the same date
thought most likely for a gen-
eral election.

Mr Blair is expected to an-
nounce the necessary emer-
gency legislation to suspend
the local elections - for the
first time since the Second
World War.

He must also decide
whether to authorise vacci-
nations to prevent the foot-
and-mouth outbreak.

Mr Blair ts said to favour
the vaccines, believing they
could help control the crisis
without the needless slaugh-
ter of animals.

But farmers warn vacci-
nation could do long term
damage to Britain’s meat ex-
port industry.

Mr Blair’s decision to
postpone polling will how-
ever please farmers’ leaders
and some of the Church of
England’s most senior bish-
ops who urged him not to
hold a general election while
the foot-and-mouth epidemic
persisted.

election.

But he declined to take a
position on the Taiwan inde-
pendence issue, but said the
notions of “independence”
and “sovereignty are be-
coming outdated in this era
of globalisation.

The Tibetan religious
leader stressed that he does
not support Tibetan inde-
pendence. Instead, he advo-
cates a high degree of au-
tonomy for the region.

A crowd of several hun-
dred supporters was at
Chiang Kai-Shek airport to
greet the Dalai Lama’s arrival.

They included Tibetan
nuns and monks in their
purple and saffron robes, and
some had come from as far
as the United States.

The trip has already an-
gered China, which views
both Taiwan and Tibet as its
own territory.

Describing the visit as
political, Beijing accused the
Dalai Lama and the Taiwan-

Dalai Lama provokes China

ese authorities of collusion to
“split the motherland”.

A front-page article in the
official China’s People’s
Daily newspaper said:

“No matter what excuses
the Taiwan authorities use to
invite the Dalai Lama, or what-
ever the form or status of the
Dalai Lama’s visit to Taiwan,
they cannot cover up their
political motives to deepen
their collusion,” the article
said.

The paper warned that
“any words or deeds which
aim to separate the mother-
land will be firmly opposed
by all the Chinese people,”
adding that they were
doomed to fail.

Beijing is strident in its
belief that both Tibet and
Taiwan are indivisible parts
of China and does all it can
to isolate both the Dalai Lama
and Taiwan’s government in-
ternationally.

The authorities said the

Gay couples wed

our gay couples have exchanged wedding vows in
Amsterdam’s City Hall under a new Dutch law that

recognises their civil marriage.

The legislation grants them the same rights as hetero-
sexual couple, including the right to adopt children.

International gay rights groups have welcomed thef
change as a big step forward.

It is part of a multi-national campaign, which is challeng-
ing the traditional definition of marniage.

The ceremony took place at midnight on Saturday (2200
GMT), with Amsterdam mayor Job Cohen officiating at the
weddings of the four same-sex couples - three male and one §
female.

Government ministers were present and it was broadcast
live on national television.

All four couples have cohabited for several years and
the women, Anne-Marie Thus and Helene Faasen, have a
nine-month-old son, born through artificial insemination.

“We are so ordinary, if you saw us on the street you’d
just walk right past us,” Anne-Marie Thus was quoted as
saying.

“The only thing that’s going to take some getting used
to is calling her ‘my spouse’,” she said.

The couples were welcomed by applause from family and
supporters as they arrived for the ceremony, but a handful of
demonstrators protested against what they called the un-
natural union.

“We hope these people will choose to return to the Lord,”
said Cor de Vries, a 30-year-old protester.

Women fall for fictional bachelor

HF or a few giddy wecks, a rich American bachelor named

Bob Harris was the fantasy of legions of Colombian
women —~ and even a few men.

Six thousand sent e-mails and checked him out on the
Internet.

Many more dialled a toll-free number, pining to meet the
blond, tanned executive who raced cars, abstained from vice,
and sought a Colombian bride to share his lonely mansion in
Arkansas.

Alas, none of it was true, the heartbroken masses found
out this week.

The adventurous man whose Web site, television spots &
and magazine and newspaper classifieds exalting Colombian
women’s “latin flavour” was the invention of a deceptive
advertising campaign to sell cars.

The campaign drawing attention to the launch of a new
Renault sedan has some crying foul. How, critics say, could
anyone so callously prey on women’s dreams of love, riches
and an escape from their war-torn country?

But the young Colombian advertising executives who
came up with the idea are patting themselves on the back.

“We’ve sold more cars in the first three days than we
expected to in a month,” said Jose Miguel Sokoloff of the
Lowe Partners agency in Bogota.

Renault’s marketing director in Colombia also defended
the campaign, though it did bruise some feelings. “We never
meant to make fun of them, far from that,” Miguel Rojo y
Pinto said in an interview.

The fictional Bob burst onto thg scene March 11.Colom-§
bia was bombarded with TV spots and print ads laying bare
his desire for a Colombian woman between 30 and 35 to form§
a “loving and affectionate” family.

“Hi, I’m Bob Harris. I’m 39 years old,” read one of the
ads, complete with a photo of Bob in a blue blazer and yellow
tie. “I’m solvent, faithful, sincere and romantic. I don’t dnnk
or smoke, and I love to dare merengue and salsa.”

Structural defects halt acquisition of Sofitel Hotel

- here are indications
that Abuja Interna-
tional Hotel, other-

wise known as Sofitel Hotel
may be undervalued, if the
Bureau of Public Enterprises
(BPE) eventually succeeds
in harvesting a core investor
to acquire the Federal Gov-
ernment’s equity
shareholding in the Hotel.
This is because of some
structural defects detected in
its conception as well as in
its construction.

The 5-star hotel built by
the Federal Capital Develop-
ment Authority (FCDA) on
behalf of the Federal Gov-
ernment, was contracted to
Tripple “P” in 1991 and ini-
tially billed to be completed
and handed over to the cli-
ent in 1994. To date how-
ever, the hotel project with
an edifice akin to some
Sofitel hotels in other coun-
tries is yet to be completed.

Sofitel Hotel is listed
among 39 enterprises to be
privatised in the second
phase of the ongoing priva-
tisation programme, going

timetable approved

Indications have
emerged however that
potential investors easily get
discouraged from acquiring
the hotel after discovering
that it was constructed
without a conference hall,
car Park, as well as other
structural defects observed in
its plan and construction.

The head of BPE’s Pub-
lic Affairs, Joe Chigbo
Anichebe who confirmed
investors’ reluctance in ex-
pressing interest in the ho-
tel at a media briefing last
Wednesday in Abuja, how-
ever observed that “some few
investors’ had shown
interest in buying off the
Hotel “but under certain
conditions.”

Anichebe noted that one
of such investors was will-
ing to pay US $ 20 million
(about N220 million) if it

will be allowed to use the
Abuja International Confer-
ence Centre as the Hotel’s
conference hall, since the

Business Day investiga-
tions revealed that over
N245 million has so far been
invested on the project by the
government.

It is yet unclear why the
government abandoned the

Hotel project which has
reached about 80 per cent of
completion. While some
have attributed the
government’s decision to
suspend work on the project
to the structural defects
observed in its conception, a
source at the FCDA told
Business Day that “the
project was abandoned for
security reasons,” in view of
its proximity to the Interna-
tional Conference Centre
where Heads of State and
foreign delegates converge
for various events.

According to NCP’s re-
vised timetable for phase II
of the ongoing privatisation
programme, the process of
privatising Abuja Interna-
tional Hotel commenced
with the selection of advis-
ers in February. Advertise-
ments for expressions of in-
terests (EOIs) will be placed
in the media by May, while
a core investor for the Hotel
will be announced by No-
vember, 2001.

Whether or not the BPE
can harvest a core investor
for Sofitel Hotel is something
which time shall tell.

Two Nigerian banks named in money transfer scam

idas Merchant
Bank and Oxford
Securities and

Investments Ltd, Lagos,
have been named as the fi-
nancial institutions into
which a New York-based
medial doctor and his son
transferred part of proceeds
from a fraudulent securities
scheme for which they are
indicted.

The indictment, made in
a U.S. court in Manhattan on
February 26, alleges that Dr.
Joshua Gurin and his son,
Edward, deceitfully made
about 11 individuals to part
with 1.87 million dollars on
the pretext that they were
buying into new businesses
that would double or triple
their investments in a matter
of days.

In one of the deals,
Edward Gurin asked an in-
vestor in May 2000 to pur-
chase warrants in a com-
pany, Actium Pharmaceuti-

cal, which he said was go-
ing to be bought in three days
at a premium by a company
named Schering Haas.

According to the indict-
ment obtained by the North
America correspondent of
the News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN), Gurin assured the
investor that the deal was
“100 per cent safe” and
“suaranteed” by Barclays
Bank of England and Chase
Manhattan Bank of New
York.

But the prosecutor al-
leges in the indictment that
Actium had actually not is-

sued any warrants. It also
had not entered into any
agreement or negotiation on
the purchase of any war-
rants, neither did Barclays
nor chase Manhattan guar-
antee the transaction.

The indictment also
states that there was no com-
pany like Schering Hass,
which Gurin had alleged
was about to purchase
Actium.

“In addition, the pro-
ceeds that (the investor) sent
to Edward Gurin were for-
warded to Midas Merchant
Bank and then to Oxford

Securities and Investments
Ltd in Lagos, Nigeria,” the
indictment states.

The defendant used Glo-
bal Industries International
Inc, controlled by his father,
Joshua Gurin, to make the
transfer to Nigeria, the pros-
ecutor wrote.

Though the indictment
does not state the amount in-
volved in the case of this
particular investor whose
money was transferred to
Nigeria, it shows that four
individuals involved in the
Actium warrant deal lost a
total of 755,000 dollars.

FG urged to re-examine economic policies

he Registrar and
Chief Executive of
Association of Na-

tional Accountants of Ni-
geria (ANAN), Mr. Peter
Ibekwe, has urged the Fed-
eral Government to re-ex-
amine the nation’s economic
policies as an alternative to
turn the economy around.

“Sometimes, our policies
are rather lopsided and not
properly focused, and there
are policy inconsistencies
which tend to jeopardise our
process of growth,” Ibekwe
said in Port Harcourt.

He said that the policy
re-examination should focus
on the economic projections,
adding: “we should think of
stability of the nation, be-
cause when the country is
not stable, our economic
growth tend to be greatly un-

dermined”’.

Ibekwe said that since
foreign investment was cru-
cial to the nation’s economic
recovery, the government
should tackle the problem of
security of lives and property
to attract foreign investors.

He also advised the gov-
ernment against
deregulating the oil sector,
saying: “it is not timely. De-
regulation is good, but it will
be wrong to apply it at the
moment.”

“In other words, it is not
timely to deregulate the oil
industry. If government
wants deregulation to suc-
ceed, it should ensure ad-
equate supply of petroleum
products,” he said.

Ibekwe advised that any
deregulation in future should
be done “in phases and

gradually, and not wholesale
or abruptly”.

He decried the e<..uuct of
people sabotaging fuel sup-
ply efforts by diverting fuel
for their selfish interests.

Ibekwe urged the govern-
ment to tackle the problem
of unemployment with seri-
ousness by promoting small-
scale industries, saying:
“even in advanced countries,
that is the system they adopt
in order to achieve economic
growth” and curb jobless-
ness.

“Tt provides employment,
mobilises the people and cre-
ates initiative,” he said, add-
ing: “serious galvanisation
of efforts towards promoting
small-scale industries is the
answer to our economic
problems”.

ANAN Registrar admits

differences

he Registrar and
Chief Executive of
the Association of

National Accountants of Ni-
geria (ANAN), Mr. Peter
Ibekwe, has acknowledged
that there was still division
between ANAN and the In-
stitute of Chartered Ac-
countants of Nigeria
(ICAN).

Speaking in an interview
in Port Harcourt, [bekwe
said that the division
between the two bodies was
one of the factors hindering
the growth of the
accountancy profession in
the count~ .

shere is no oneness,
there is no team spirit, no co-
operation,” declared Ibekwe,

with ICAN

adding: “what we require is
to bury the hatchet and work
with each other in order to
move the country forward,
because the economy re-
quires the services of the ac-
countant to manage the re-
sources.”

According to Ibekwe, in
times of adversities, account-
ants were required to prop-
erly manage the lean re-
sources, and in periods of
plenty, they were needed to
manage the surplus wealth.

For over one year, the
two-legally accredited ac-
counting bodies have been
locked in legal battle at the
Federal High Court in Lagos,
with ICAN challenging the
promulgation of ANAN De-
cree 76 of 193.

NEPA embarks on mass disconnection in Jalingo

he Jalingo District of
the National Electric
Power Authority

(NAPA) in Taraba has em-
barked on mass disconnec-
tion to recover the debts
owed it by consumers.

The District Manager of
the Authority, Mr. Rilwanu
Suleiman, said in Jalingo,
that customers owed the dis-
trict about N28 million.

Suleiman explained that
non-payment of bills by
some consumers and illegal
connections were adversely
affecting the smooth opera-
tions of the Authority, thus
the erratic power supply be-

-

ing experienced in the area.

He said that the district
was rated the lowest in terms
of electricity supply and rev-
enue collection in the coun-
try and urged consumers to
settle their bills promptly and
stop illegal connections and
safeguard NEPA installa-
tions

In the disconnection no
category of customers was
spared as even government
buildings were included.

Meanwhile, consumers
have started responding fa-
vourably, as long payment
queues were noticed in the
district office.

NUB Recapitalisation:

Shareholders sue CBN, three others

our shareholders of
H the Nigeria Universal

Bank International
Limited, including the
former Minister of Agricul-
ture, Alhaji Sani Zangon
Daura, have sought for an
interim injunction from the
High Court of Justice in
Kaduna, restraining the
Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN) and three other de-
fendants from rejecting their
shareholding in the Bank,
pending the hearing and de-
termination of a Motion on
Notice from the Court.

The CBN had last year
re-capitalised the shares of
Nigeria Universal Bank Ltd.
(NUB), which led to its
transformation into the Ni-
geria Universal Bank Inter-
national Ltd., with four
shareholders, Cuvest Invest-
ments Ltd., Falalu Bello
Group, Kaduna & Katsina
State Governments and
Hikima Group each owing
51 percent, 20.77 percent,
20.00 per cent and 8.23 per
cent respectively.

In a Motion-Exparte No.
KDH/KAD/212/2001 filed
against Cuvest Investments
Limited, Alhaji M.I. Yahaya,
‘CBN and NUB International
Bank Ltd. respectively, in the
Kaduna High Court by the
four shareholders, the plain-
tiffs prayed the court to grant
their three prayers, which
are:

- A declaration that
the act of the rejection of the
purchase of shares of the
plaintiffs by the third defend-
ant (CBN) ts in bad faith, un-
lawful, unwarranted, null
and void.

- An order restrain-
ing the defendants jointly

and severally acting through
their agents, assigns, or
whosoever from rejecting the
shareholding of the plain-
tiffs.

Joseph Sanusi,
CBN governor.

And an order re-
straining the third defend-
ants particularly the defend-
ant from altering in any
manner the shareholding al-
ready agreed between the
parties and duly executed on
the 8" of January, 2001.

The Motion-Exparte
made available to Business
Day revealed that upon hear-
ing, Y. Mahmood Esq.,
Counsel to the Plaintiff/Ap-
plicant and after reading
through the affidavit in sup-
port of the application com-
ing up for hearing on 17"
day of April, 2001, before
Justice T. Zailani, Judge.
The Court restrained the de-
fendants/respondents jointly
and severally from rejecting
the shareholding of the
plaintiffs pending the hear-
ing and determination of the
Motion on Notice.

It also restrained them

from altering in any manner
the shareholding already
agreed between the parties
and duly executed on the 8"
of January, 2001 pending the
hearing and determination
of the motion on notice.
The plaintiffs claimed in
the complaint that MFB
Holdings had, through a let-
ter dated November 28"
2000 investigated and con-
firmed to the CBN that “all
four plaintiffs have liqui-
dated their loans, or have
than the
amounts used in proposing

repaid more

for the or purchasing of the
shares.

Notwithstanding the
MFB Holding’s letter how-
ever, wrote a letter No. BSD/
G1.T3/10/Vol.1/9 dated 20"
March, 2001, to the Execu-
tive Chairman of NUB Inter-
national Bank Ltd., rejecting
the four plaintiffs as pro-
posed investors, almost three
months after the memoran-
dum of understanding were
signed and sources of funds
were certified as appropriate.

The plaintiffs therefore
filed a suit challenging the
their
shareholding in the Bank by
the four defendants.

The court ordered the de-
fendants to appear before it,
physically or by proxy on the
date of the hearing (April 17,
2001).

It notified the defendants
that in default of their ap-
pearance before it, “the
plaintiffs may proceed
therein and judgement may
be given in their absence.”

Poor technology hampers

oor technology has

of the obstacles to the

was made by Dr. Onaolapo
Soleye, former Commis-
sioner of Works and Finance
in Ogun State at the convo-
cation lecture of the Centre
for Technology: Policy in
Yaba, Lagos State.

Soleye who said this
situation results from the low

ence and technology, urged
the government to focus ad-
equate attention to science
and technology develop-
ment. He stressed that
things had gone wrong from

Talking on “Generating
Wealth from Knowledge,”
he cited the example of Dee
Bee Wines Mack derived
from Kolanut by a Nigerian,

Pauline Tallen,
Science & Technology Minister.

Dr. D.B.A. Ogutuga. Soleye
lamented the inability of Ni-
gerians to manufacture ordi-
nary wirehoods and corks to
bottle our wines.

“It is disappointing that
such little things as corks
and wirehoods which prob-
ably were made by roadside
engineers in India must be
imported for use in Nigeria.
Nigeria can’t be a friend of
other nations at the expense
of herself. We are friends
with Taiwan, Indonesia,
among others under the
guise of free trade, without
adequately exploiting the
economic benefits of such a
relationship, but for us to
gain international accept-
ability as a “democratic na-
tion’.

ernment, in conjunc-

tonal first aid society, has
worked out a Bee-keeping
programme targeted toward

Joshua Dariye,
Plateau State Governor.

rural women and youths.

The State Commissioner
for Information, Mr. Ame:
Azi, who made the disclo-
sure while speaking with
newsmen, said that the pro-
gramme, which is part of the
state government’s effort to-
wards making people self-
reliant, would also assist in
conserving forest resources
and bees.

He said that 17 commu-
nities had already been se-
lected for the programme
while the sum of N7.5 mil-
lion had been approved by
the state government as its
counterpart funding of a to-
tal of N59 million, part of
which would be provided by
the International Fund for
Agricultural Development
(IFAD).

Amos said that the state

government had similarly
approved the establishment
of the Plateau State Rural
Wate: Supply and Sanitation
Agency.

When operational, the

Commissioner said the

Agency would be responsi-
ble for the provision of po-
table water all over the state,
in addition to regulating
sanitary conditions, in line
with the National and Inter-
national Standards as pro-
vided for in the UN enabling
law number LN 3322.

He also stated that the
state government had ap-
proved the establishment of
a State council of arts and
culture to take care of cul-
tural activities as well as pre-
paring a cultural calendar
that would boost the tourism
potentials of the state.

Zambia Bank targets $3.8n HIPC debt relief

ambia Central Bank
warned that the
country may face a

very difficult environment if
it failed to meet conditions
for $3.8 billion debt relief
package.

Fredrick Chiluba,
Zambian President.

“We have to meet the
Highly Indebted Poor Coun-
tries’ (HIPC) benchmarks.
Failure to do this will lead
to a very difficult environ-
ment,” Bank of Zambia gov-
ernor, Jacob Mwanza told
newsmen.

The debt relief agree-
ment, under an initiative for
HIPC, requires that Zambia
continues its privatisation
programme, fights HIV/
AIDS and boosts spending
on education and health.

Economists say these tar-
gets, in addition to good po-
litical governance and trans-
parency, are threatened by
the government’s reluctance
to complete its privatisation
agenda and elections later
this year.

President Fredrick
Chiluba will complete his
second and final five-year
term late this year, but he has
banned debate on his succes-
sor within the ruling Move-
ment for Multiparty Democ-
racy (MMD).

Chiluba has drawn criti-
cism from the opposition and
some members of his own
party by encouraging sup-
porters to discuss the merits
of extending his term.

Analysts say the tempta-
tion to loosen purse strains
in an election year would
have to be avoided if donor
conditions for HIPC and
other programme funding
are to be met.

Mwanza also said that

measures he took in January
to stabilise a slumping
kwacha currency had yielded
favourable results.

“We have achieved sta-
bility for the kwacha,”
Mwanza told reporters at his
quarterly briefing.

The kwacha traded at an
average of 3,150 against the
dollar, last week compared to
4,700 in January 2001 and
2,650 in January, 2000.

... 25 MF lists conditions for aid to Kenya

he International Mon-
etary Fund (IMF)
said it would resume

lending to Kenya only if the
country completed reforms
on good governance and pri-
vatisation.

A visiting IMF team said
in a statement that Kenya
had made encouraging
progress in fighting corrup-
tion but it wanted the gov-
emment to complete prom-
ised reforms by the end of
April to enable the Fund ex-
perts to return in mid-May
to prepare fresh lending.

“The IMF mission hopes
that sufficient progress
would have been made in all
areas of Kenya’s pro-
grammes by end April to al-
low a mission to complete
discussions... by mid-May
2001,” the statement said at
the end of the two-week visit.

The IMF and other do-
nors have suspended dis-
bursement of over $200 mil-
lion in loans to the economi-
cally-fragile country of 28
million after Kenya failed to
meet key aid conditions re-
lating to privatisation and
measures against graft.

The fund has demanded
the re-establishment of an
independent corruption
agency with powers of pros-

ecution after Kenya’s High
Court declared the Kenya
anti corruption authority un-
constitutional last Decem-
ber.

Richard Leakey quit as
head of the civil service and
Kenya’s chief corruption
buster and president Daniel
Arap Moi dismissed three
top civil servants closely
linked to Leakey, including
the finance permanent sec-
retary.

The IMF said the gov-
ernment, seen by its critics
as hampered by corruption,
had praised the passage by
parliament of bills outlawing
so-called economic crimes
and establishing a code of
conduct and ethics for the
three branches of govern-
ment.

The government would
ensure the central bank -con-

. trolled monetary policy and

interest rates remained mar-
ket-determiffed, it said.
The statement. said the
immediate challenge facing
Kenya was to contain imbal-
ances that had resulted from
a delay in disbursement of
finanqal help and avoid “un-
sustainable large increases in
domestic interest rates and a
destabilisation of the micro-
economic environment.”

The country’s total vol-
ume of African trade has ex-
ceeded 11 percent, with its
share of African exports
standing at 15 per cent, sec-
ond only to that of South
Africa.

The President of
AFREXIMBANK, Dr.
Christopher Edordu who
disclosed this, said at the
signing of an agreement for
the opening of Nigeria’s
branch office in Abuja that
the money was approved for
the financing of banks,
telecoms sector, oil services
and software commodities,
Pharmaceuticals, aviation,
cotton and textiles, plastics,
hides and skins, as well as
light manufactures.

Edordu, a Nigerian, dis-
closed further that “the bank
also leveraged considerable
inflow of international trade
finance into Nigeria through
the implementation of its
guarantee facilities.” He said
Nigerian entities have also
benefited “strongly” from
the Bank’s advisory services.

The Bank, whose
headquarter is located in
Cairo, Egypt, was estab-
lished on October 27, 1993

after leaders of 30 African
countries converged in
Abuja to sign an agreement
to ratify the treaty establish-
ing it. Nigeria is a major
shareholder of the Bank,
with the Nigerian govern-
ment and private sharehold-
ers holding about 20 percent
of the Bank’s equity.
Edordu who represents
Nigerian Export-Import
Bank (NEXIM), noted that
the Bank mostly operate
through its trade finance in-
termediaries, 88 commercial
and merchant banks spread
across 22 countries, with 30
of them from Nigeria.
Some of the Bank’s
achievements so far, accord-

ing to its President, include
acceleration of the return of
international banks to Af-
rica, which guarantees sig-
nificant inflow of interna-
tional finance, about US $20
million into the continent. It
has also been able to attract
more than US $10 for every
one US dollar it invested in
African deals, he added.

Earlier in his speech, the
Minister of State for Fi-
nance, Senator Jubril Mar-
tins-Kuye enthused that
AFREXIMBANK guaran-
tees a conducive atmosphere
for the enhancement of Ni-
gerran small and medium-
scale enterprises (SMEs).

The agreement and
memorandum of under-
standing for the establish-
ment of the Abuja branch
office of AFREXIM was
signed for Nigeria by the
Ministers of State for Fi-
nance and Foreign Affairs,
Martins-Kuye and Dubem
Onyia respectively, while’
Edordu and Dr. Shamsudeen

State House, the Chairman,
Metropolitan Bank Limited,
Chief Stephen Bakare noted
the positive impacts of the
government’s new macro-
economic policy on banking
and called for enforcement
of the Bankruptcy Law in
order to curtail issuance of
dud cheques.

He also stressed that
banks should be allowed to
serve as collection centres
for payment of all utilities
such as water and NEPA
bills among others.

By Suleiman Mohammed

Bakare also proposed
that banks should have the
full advantage of the provi-
sion of legal mortgages with-
out court intervention, say-
ing the present practice has
negative impact on the bank-
ing industry.

While commending
President Obasanjo for intro-
ducing various programmes
targeted at the general wel-
fare of Nigerians, Bakare
said Metropolitan Bank has
been re-engineered inline
with the Universal Banking
concept, adding that the new
economic policies have posi-
tive impact on the bank.

President Olusegun
Obasanjo while re-affirming
government’s commitment
to rejuvenate the economy in
order to attract more inves-

tors, told the bankers that
their contributions in this
direction was necessary.
The President spoke of
his administration’s commit-
ment to fight corruption at
all levels, and advised the
financial institutions to be
steadfast and curtail the
alarming cases of advance
fee fraud (419) that bastard-
ised the banking sector.

he Fantswam of Kafanchan have
their origins in the Bauchi area,
and they moved over to their
present location in a series of migrations
which occurred over a long period of time.
The ancestors of the Fantswam were
hunters, and the vast fields of Kafanchan
still provide ample room for a variety of
activities including hunting. One can
easily understand why the ancients
accepted to reside around these hills,and
the infinity of rolling fields. The original
name of the people was “Fantswam”.
}Over the years, the latter name underwent
forms of alteration, until it resulted in
Kafanchan as we know it today.
Kafanchan is a tourists delight. There
* the singing waters of River Wonder-
ful to charm and thrill you, sfor starters.
The waters flow from a height in a grace-
ful cascade, and when they hit the waters
beneath they instantly foam and become
lithe in an almost magical sequence. Then
swiftly they move into powerful currents
that surge forward, almost courageously.
What a sight! The spray, and the echo of
the pounding waters is an unforgettable
experience Picnickers and bathers also
gather around the little waterfall here. The
high embankments impress with their
silent joyfulness.

The waterfall. There are picnickers in the foreground

Kafanchan: Singing waters of ‘River Wonderful’

Trees are being felled in great quantity.

Banana plants blossom nearby, and the
flash of cameras is a continuing experi-
ence.

Then there is a natural staircase or so,
which has formed after years of move-
ment both to and from the waterfall.

There are forests around Kafanchan
too, where people can hunt and go for long
walks, or have picnics. In the forests one
also encounters forms of architecture
which have a traditional aspect. There are
palm trees in the forest also. However,

there is a lot of destructive work going
on in the forest. The trees are being felled,
and cut into logs of wood for commer-
cial purposes. The beauty of the forest is
fading away, while the animals naturally
move further afield to escape the influ-
ence of men and machines. A terrible
devastation is unfolding here.

In the distance a sawing machine
whines mournfully as it fells another tree,
and then another. There are streams in the
forest. Some of them have free flowing

waters, while the waters of others have
been halted by logs of wood or trees
which have fallen across the course.

Also there are historical trees in the
forest. Several mango trees mark the spot
where the ancestors of the Fantswam first
resided when they came out of the forest.

There is another little forest which is
being protected by the community under
the watchful eye of Aegwam Fantswam,
the Chief of the Fantswam. The forest is
central to the culture of the people, and it
is being preserved so that future genera-
tions would have an idea of the culture of|
the people. This is a clear example of how
a collective decision by a community can
help to preserve an environment.
Kafanchan is made up of Hausa and
Fulani also.

In Kafanchan, there are little hills and
larger rocks are found in the distance be-
hind the forest. In the forest there are re-
mains of the dwellings of the ancients.
At least an outline of a fence was percep-
tible at one spot. There are flourishing
Banana, Palm, and Guava trees. In
Kafanchan there are rolling fields, and
plains, and some forests too. There are
the endless accents out of ‘River won-
derful’ which speak to the talents slum-
bering in the man.

readiness to cooperate with
the Plateau State Government
in the provision of water and
sanitary facilities.
Consequently, the state
government has approved
the establishment of an
additional parastatal, Plateau
State Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Agency to liaise
with the Japanese agency.
Disclosing this at the end

of the executive council
meeting held at Rayfield, Jos,
the State commissioner for
Information, Mr. Amos Azi,
also said other projects such
as sinking of bore-holes,
provision of pit latrines,
concrete walls and tubes in
rural areas would be executed
in concert with UNICEF.
Mr. Amos Azi also added
that Direct Labour Agency
and Ministry of Water
Re icacs and Rural
Development would also
liaise with the foreign
agencies so as to achieve the
desired objectives.
He stated that based on
the rural needs of the people,
the state has been zoned for
easy project implementation,
adding that local contractors
would be used on the
projects for which N200
million has been set aside.
Mr. Azi also disclosed
that the state government had

approved the establishment
of a Council for Arts and
Culture which would be
yeaded by an Exscutive
secretary, “to take care of

She maintained that it was
only through selfless service
by the haves that life could

She, therefore, called on
people in the state to always

assist the needy whenever
the need arose.

Earlier, the chairman of
the Jibia local government,
Alhaji Sani Jibia, announced
the council’s donation of

The call was made by the
Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji
Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, when
the chairman, governing
board of the college paid him
a courtesy call in Dutse. He
said if the North had “such
learning center here, it would
make it easier for our people
to enrol in the institution, 1.e.
the training of our civil
servants here’.

The governor pointed out

APP stalwart justifies
Ogunshola’s removal

he removal of the
former chairman of
the All Peoples’ Party

(APP) in Kwara State, Prof.
Albert Ogunshola, was long
overdue, the former acting
chairman of the party in the
state, Alhaji M.K. ljatya, has
said.

In a press chat with Daily
Trust in florin, Alhaji Ijatya
said, the dissolution of the
state executive council by the
APP national secretariat was
in order.

According to Alhaji Ijaiya,
for the APP to.win and record
a resounding victory in the
local government elections
next year, there must be total
re-organisation of the party in
the state.

He said there was no crisis
within the party at the national
or state levels, explaining
however, that APP governors
rallied round to save Dr.
Olusola Saraki, from being
suspended from the party for
anti-party activities at the last
APP meeting held in Jigawa
state.

Alhaji Ijatya noted that Dr.
Saraki contributed immensely

From Abdul Laro,
in Tlorin

to the growth of the party,
hence the pardon granted him
by the party, because “as a
human being, nobody is 100
percent perfect”.

Answering another
question, the former acting
chairman said there was no
problem between Governor
Muhammed Lawal and Dr.
Saraki since government
differed from the party.

Alhaji Ijaiva said the
government had every right
to choose and_ invite
anybody as commissioner,
based on his prerogative.

He said even though
Chief Ige was from the
Alhiance for Democracy (AD),
yet President Olusegun
Obasanjo invited him to
serve in his government.

He added that Prof.
Ogunshola wanted to impose
commissioners on governor
Lawal which was resisted.

Alhaji Ijatya also boasted
that the AD and PDP in the
state could never pose a threat
to the APP, because while the
AD was not rooted, the PDP
was not an organised party.

Zamfara declares Muslim new year public holiday

amfara State has
declared every first

(Muslims Calendar) a public
holiday in the state.

The Governor of Zamfara
State, Alhaji Ahmed Sani,
disclosed this during thie
launching of this year’s
Muslim’s calendar, held at the
Ali Akilu Square in Gusau,
the state capital, during the
week.

Alhaji Ahmed Sani also
explained that with the
introduction of the Sharia
legal system in the state, it
was expedient to inculcate
Islamic knowledge in our
children, noting that children
had been taught only the
Gregorian calendar with little
or no knowledge of the
Muslim calendar.

From Salisu Zakari
Maradun, in Gusau

He further explained that,

Gov. Ahmed
“we have to do something as

it is not serving our interest
as Muslims, and for our
young ones, we have to teach
them our religion.”

Apparently referring to
his critics, the governor took
time to explain some of the
socio-economic policies
being introduced by his
government.

Governor Ahmed Sani,
said further that “those who
think we are wasting public
funds are only ignorant of
the programme as we have
not spent 10 percent of our
capital expenditure on the
plogramme.”

Commenting further,
governor Sani reiterated his
administration’s deter-
mination to pursue Islamic
legal system to its logical
end.

He maintained that he
was physically and mentally
prepared to face any
consequences, asserting, “I
am ready to die for it
(Sharia)”’.

She stated this at Okene at
the commissioning of the

Mrs. Onikepo Oshodi, said

Mrs. Oshodi also
deplored a situation where

ramshackle buildings that
tend to put the school in a bad
light, stressing that “with the
management team here, a
conducive atmosphere for

She further allayed the
fears of Nigerians on the

National ID cards kick off October

Federal
hohe “would
recruit about 600,000

ad-hoc workers for the
operations of the national
identity card programme,
scheduled to start in October
this year, the News Agency
of Nigeria (NAN) reports.
“We are going to employ
600,000 ad-hoc workers to
man the 120,000 polling units
nationwide, we are expected
to use five to six persons per
unit, to register Nigerians for
the issuance of the cards,”
the Minister of State for
Internal Affairs, Alhaji
Mohammed Shata, told NAN
in Abuja at the weekend.
Shata said that the

workers would be recruited
in a collaborative arrange-
ment with the Department of
Civil Registration (DNCR),
INEC, and the National
Population Commission
{NPC) for the registration of
eligible Nigerians.

He said in an interview,
shortly after receiving the
report of the tenders’
analysis sub-committee for
the national ID project, that
while the registration of
Nigerians was billed to start
in October, the actual
issuance of the cards would
take-off in the first quarter of
next year. The Minister said
that the Federal Government
had already approved N18.4

billion for the collaborative
programme between DNCR,
INEC and NPC to ensure the
implementation of the project.

He, however, said that the
National Assembly had only
approved N7.4 billion of the
amount in this year’s federal
budget for its take-off.

He solicited the assis-
tance and co-operation of
states and local govern-
ments, traditional rulers, and
other community leaders to
facilitate the smooth
registration and eventual
issuance of the cards.

Shata further appealed to
the media to support the
programme, by enlightening
Nigerians on the benefits of

Population contd. from pg 1

protection of young ones,”
adding that the child-bearing
behaviour of today’s young
people will do much to
determine whether Nigeria is
able to achieve a decline in
population growth rates, it
says.

Other issues that are of
particular importance to the
population and development
situation in Nigeria, as
contained in the draft,
include reproductive health
which is a state of complete
physical, mental and social
well being, and not merely the

absence of disease or
infirmity.

The draft states that
individuals, in the exercise of
their rights under the
reproductive health issue,
should be free to make
decisions concerning
reproduction free of
discrimination, coercion and
violence as expressed in the
human rights documents.

“In the exercise of this
right, individuals should take
into account, the social,
economic and emotional
needs of their children and

their responsibilities towards
the community, respect for
the reproductive rights of all
Nigerians is a corerstone of
the national policy on
population,” it says.

It notes that although
knowledge of family
planning is considerably
higher than its use, activities
shall be expanded at all levels
to provide wiser availability
and choice of family planning
services, by government and
non-governmental
organisations.

the identity cards and its
relevance to national growth
and development.

According to him, “the

national ID is beneficial to
Nigerians, as it would enable
them to be distinguishable
from non-Nigerians and also

assist during electoral

processes and demographic

_ needs.”

Mi ilos e VIC contd. from pg I

ing behind it.

A top official from ex-
leader’s Socialist Party,
Vladimir Ivkovic, said Mr
Milosevic had decided to
give himself up of his own
free will.

Government negotiators
had spent several hours in-
side trying to secure a peace-
ful end to the stand-off,
amidst speculation until the
last minute that force would
have to be used.

Mr Milosevic was
thought to have been holed
up in the villa with his wife
and daughter and about 20
well-armed and possibly
drunken bodyguards.

His defenders fought off
a special police assault on
the villa in the early hours of
Saturday and Mr Milosevic
earlier insisted that he would
“not go to jail alive”.

Serbian Deputy Prime
Minister Zarko Korac told
the BBC that the ex-presi-
dent was in a distraught men-
tal state prior to his arrest.

According to officials
who had seen him, “he was
unbalanced, he was threaten-
ing, showing his gun - he was

saying he would kill himself
and his family,” Mr Korac
said.

This account is at odds
with a statement given by an
apparently relaxed and cheer-
ful Mr Milosevic that was
broadcast on Belgrade’s Ra-
dio B92 only 24 hours earlier.

Mr Milosevic faces
charges in Yugoslavia of cor-
ruption and theft of state
funds.

He is wanted on war
crimes charges by the Inter-
national Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia.

But, addressing a news
conference in Belgrade,
Serbian Interior Minister
Dusan Mihajlovic said he
would not be arrested on the
international indictment for
war crimes.

The minister made it clear
that he would not be extra-
dited to the Hague.

The arrest coincides with
the expiry of a US deadline
for the Yugoslav government
to detain the former presi-
dent or risk losing substan-
tial American economic aid
and loans from the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund and

the World Bank.

The White House has
said nothing publicly about
the situation, partly in an ef-
fort to avoid complicating
matters further for the
Yugoslav authorities.

US officials had indicated
that the arrest of Mr
Milosevic would be regarded
as an important first step but
Washington still wants to
see him brought before the
war crimes tribunal in The
Hague.

A decision on whether to
release some $50m of aid is
expected on Monday; but
despite the fact that Presi-
dent Kostunica shows no
signs of preparing to extra-
dite Mr Milosevic, US offi-
cials say the Bush adminis-
tration 1s expected to recom-
mend that the funds be re-
leased.

The UK has welcomed
the arrest in the name of.
people seeking peace and
justice in the Balkans.

“It is another important
step towards bringing
Milosevic and his cronies to
book for their crimes against
humanity,” Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said.

poor performance since
assumption of office.

“Our people have been
cheated and neglected for
too long and all we are
saying is that the south-west
has no business ruling this
country for 8 years when the
zone is not producing the

“The current face-off

Apparently in its effort to

Secretary of the

retrenching over 6,000
workers in spite of the

According to him, the

He said Governor Tinubu
has been acting in a way that
suggests that he has no
regard for democracy. “People

«who want to be identified as
defenders of democracy
should at least create jobs
and provide for welfare of the
people rather than kill jobs
and create hardship,” he said.

Mr. Odah added that due
process was not followed and
that it was coming “‘from those
who the other day were self-
professed democrats’.

He said the sack in other
states 1s equally unacceptable
because it was done in
“fragrant disobedience of
tackling redundancy which
would have _— entailed
negotiation and dialogue.”

“We see these states’
chief executives as enemies of
workers. Worse still, they are
already campaigning for
second terms, “he said.

Comrade Odah stated that
the NLC is already working on
modalities to ensure that
workers’ rights are not
trampled upon.

National Co-ordinator of the
Committee of Patriots (CP),
Alhaji Shuaibu Badegi, has
demanded for unreserved
apology from the Federal
Government for his arrest and
detention, an action, he said,
was an infringement on his
right of expression.

Badegi, who was the co-
ordiantor of a self-sponsored
campaign for the former
military President, Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida, to
contest the 2003 presidential
election, later denounced his

course after he was arrested
and detained by security
operatives.

The former co-oordinator,
who is the Director-General of
the newly established Media
Corporation in Niger State,
told the News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) in Minna last
Thursday, “I am compelled to
demand for an unreserved
apology from the Federal
Government and Prof. Jerry
Gana because of the minister’s
recent statement that my
arrest was connected with
security implication of the
campaign for IBB’s
presidential candidacy”.

he State Independent
Electoral Commission
(SIEC) has a vital role

to play in the democratic
process of this country.

The Deputy Governor of
Rivers State, Sir Gabriel Toby,
made the assertion while
speaking at the 2" national
conference of the State’s
Independent Electoral
Commission (SIEC) held in
Port Harcourt recently.

Sir Toby said that given
SIEC’s composition, with all
members being stake-
holders in the operational
areas, it would bring about
an end to electoral fraud.

He also said that the state
shared responsibility will
make for efficient
productivity, lead to
confidence-building, as well
as engender credible results.

Meanwhile, speaking at
the occasion, the chairman
of the Rivers State Electoral
Commission, Mr. Sam Jaja,
said that the growing
controversy over the
inauguration of state inde-
pendent electoral commi-
ssions was borne out of
ignorance.

According to him, the
country’s political system “is
not yet mature enough to

He said the argument
against State Electoral

Mr. Jaja reasoned that if

that the President can also

PARLIAMENT

Vithin the Nigerian
polity, Senator Jo-
seph Kennedy Waku

needs no introduction. But for
the purpose of records, Waku
represents the People’s Demo-
cratic Party (PDP), Benue
North-West. Frank to a fault,
Senator Waku, is the Senate
Committee Chairman on In-
surance. He spoke to Buhari
Bello, our Plateau State Corre-
spondent, on many issues affect-
ing Nigerian politics.
Excerpts:

What is your reaction to the
second term debate currently
going on?

Yes, ina nascent democracy
like ours, I would support one
term in office because of what |
perceive is likely to happen and
let me give you this analogy.
Any military intervention in this
country or any democratic in-
terruption in this country, al-
ways come as a result of second
tenure, in the sense that people
want to perpetuate themselves
in power without minding their
f performance.

It would have been easier if
the occupants of these offices
realised that they don’t have to
lobby for a second tenure be-
cause their performance will au-
tomatically guarantee them sec-
ond tenure.

So, I am really not in sup-
port of that, if] were a governor
y or the president, 1 would not
open my mouth and teil any-
body that I need a second ten-
ure. It is my action in the office
that will guarantee that. So, as a
result of that, there have been
several crises from one state to
the other, all in an attempt to
sideline other politicians who are
working to replace them. The
governors are using instrumen-
tality for which the end result
would be chaotic because Nige-
rian citizens would no longer
take such, whether or not the
military does indicate their in-
tention to come back.

Nigerians on their own
would not take it. And let me
give you a typical example. Look
at the ward congresses in Delta
State where angry councillors
torced the state governor to es-
ce pe through a church building.
Then you can see the anxiety
and i. shows that incumbency
is not a guarantee that you can
work your way and perpetuate
yourselves in office at the detri-
ment of the people. It would no
longer happen. And even if it
does happen it would mean the
incumbent carrying people
along. Any time the governor
wants to use the governmental
machinery, they could return fire
for fire in several states. That, I
ium afraid of.

But from experience, most
of these political office-holders
ide on the machinery of

rovernment to perpetuate
hemselves in office.

That is why I said there is a
anger. That is why the one term
>nure will sustain the nascent
emocracy until Nigerians nurse

iat for several years, then it will
‘abilise. So, I am absolutely in
ipport of the Constitutional
eview Committee’s recom-
iendation ofa one term tenure.

No second term for the President - sen. Wak

f By Buhari Bello, in Jos |

try, state or a local government
for a period of five years and
who fails, if you give him 15 or
20 years, he wil! still not per-
form. Therefore, I am com-
pletely m support of the five
years of one term in office.

Looking at the performance
of the ruling party (PDP), of
which you are a member, are
you satisfied and do you think
that PDP will record the kind
of victory it recorded in the past?

PDP will have to work very
hard. It will no longer have it on
a platter of gold. Those days
have come and gone and other
parties are watching and they
have been capitalising on the
party’s weaknesses. And until
PDP performs miracles, no mat-
ter the use of governmental in-
strumentality, opposing parties
will still send them packing.

Comment on the
deregulation of the petroleum
sector intended by President
Olusegun Obasanjo and the
said IMF agenda?

Well, i don’t know why you
want me to comment on that is-
sue again. I spoke on that de-
regulation during my interview
with the 7e// magazine, which
generated controversies, but to-
day it is coming. | already saw it
coming. | am totally against it
and I remain against it because
government is all about welfare.
Government is not a business
organisation that makes profit.
Government should not deregu-
late fuel prices. Indeed, | think
it ts a deliberate attempt to send
Nigerians into hardship.

So, do you feel vindicated
today over what you said in that
interview?

I cannot be a judge in my
own court. Let others make the
judgement whether I have been
vindicated or not. As a result of
that interview, some people see
me as a controversial Senator
today. I do not know if to speak
the truth qualifies you to be
controversial

IT remember you threatened
taking the magazine to court for
distorting your interview and
putting words into your mouth.
What is the situation now?

The matter is still in the
Abuja High Court.

What are you demanding?

N500m only.
How do you view the
supplementary budget

submitted by the President to
the National Assembly for the
purchase of an aircraft for the
presidential fleet in spite of the
economic hardship that
Nigerians are facing?

I have a contrary view on
the aircraft that the supplemen-
tury budget was sent for. Is it
not one aircraft? Let me say this
and this is me: I have always
been objective when I speak my
mind. That presidential jet is not
Obasanjo’s jet. Nigeria is said to
be the leader in Africa. | mean,
there is a price you have to pay
to lead the nations. It is not
Obasanjo’s jet. It belongs to the
Federal Government because he
will use it and leave it. Other

presidents will come and use it.
It is an image of the nation. I
would not want my President
to keep going in a dilapidated
jet. And in the Senate, we ad-
vised that those that are no
longer tn good condition should
be disposed off. Would you be
happy - may God forbid it - that
your President is going in an old
presidential jet with technical
problems? In as much as I am

money and Nigerians are suffer-
ing while the country has too
much money. I did mention it in
my interview with the 7e// maga-
zine. You see, like somebody
told me that “look Senator Waku,
if I were you, | would no longer
talk until the end of this four-
year tenure” because there is
nothing new that I am going to
say, that I haven’t said. We are
now coming back to the deregu-

Senator Joseph Kennedy Waku

critical of Obasanjo’s regime
about investment and economy,
I do believe also that for you to
be able to stand firm and speak,
the cloth that you wear will de-
termine the kind of person and
the country you come from or
like I said the jet is an image of
Nigeria. In fact, the only thing
that one may ask is why he de-
cided to choose that as a prior-
ity now. My comment in the
Senate was that why should that
form part of priority. But con-
sidering it at the global level, we
think it is also better, because
we think it is the nation’s image.

The fact is if the 2001 bud-
get we passed is being imple-
mented to the letter, Nigerians
wouldn’t even have to be talk-
ing about the presidential jet
because we would have been
Susy and nobody would even
look at it as something.

But you also passed the
2000 budget and the fortunes
of Nigerians did net improve.
What has the Senate done about
the said poor implementation?
Or are you telling us that the
government would fully
implement 2001 budget and if
not, what next?

We would sack him. We
would remove him if he doesn’t
implement the Nigerian budget
for Nigerians. Definitely, he has
no business to stay 1n the office
and as such, there could be a
move to remove him because this
is no joke now. It is a very seri-
ous matter It ic nat Waters

lation, I had said it. You are now
talking about IMF interest, I did
mention it that Nigerian govern-
ment has been enslaved and
Obasanjo wants to please the
IMF. So, what can I say today
that would be news? I think if I
were you the journalist inter-
viewing me, I should not talk
about Obasanjo’s issue. So, I
saw these things coming. I am
not a young man in the politics
of Nigeria and I have a purpose
of going into politics. The poli-
tics of welfarism. To assist and
develop the nation. Politics is
not just about making a name
for yourself but also about mak-
ing a social impact. If you look
at our health institution in this
country today, it is the poorest.
You know the United Nations
recommendation for health sec-
tor of every nation is | 1 percent.
Nigeria cannot even do three or
four percent and what is the
sense of that. Today Nigerians
have every good reason to ask
what happened to our educa-
tional sector, our health sector
or the economy generally. Then,
you take such huge sum to buy
one presidential jet. I know Ni-
gerians would ask that. But if
economy were booming and
people see the impact of it, no-
body would comment.

If the industrialization were
put in place, productivity was
high, people got jo. i. “body
would have talked abu.
presidential jet. Bu ase of

ment of priority today Nigeri-
ans are asking this kind of ques-
tion. In fact there would have
been support from the people
because of the image that it
would have created for the na-
tion.

There was a report alleging
poor leadership styles of the
present Senate President,
Anyim Pius Anyim, which have
been said to be responsible for
the absence of many Senators
at the Senate sittings. Can you
assess the performance of the
Senate President?

The leadership of the Sen-
ate cannot decide on what the
Senate itself could do. A Senate
President is the chairman and he
is a leader among equals. We
chose him among equals to pre-
side. He cannot be accused of
non-performance. And J am not
buying the idea that Senators’
absence 1s because of the poor
performance of the leadership.
No. The Senate and; indeed, the
National Assembly, operates in
such a manner that you need to
be one to understand and appre-
ciate the operational norms. And
you need to be closer to mem-
bers for you to know their dif-
ferent operations.

The Senate in several coun-
tries is like that. For instance, if
you watch the BBC television
reporting the Britis}: parliament
you see few members because
the others may be involved in
Committee jobs and that also
forms part of the legislative re-
sponsibilities. There are several
issues that attract the attention
of all legislatures. In fact, cer-
tain debates interest all legisla-
tors and when such issues are
brought, they are handled by the
Committee before they are pre-
sented for adoption, debates or
in some cases referred back to
the committees. This is what
many Nigerians are ignorant of.
It is not their fault. The constant
democratic interruption have
made Nigerians ignorant about
the knowledge of such respon-
sibilities. It’s not every day that
you go and seat in the chambers.
That 1s why there are Commit-
tees. Because the actual legisla-
tive work is done by the Com-
mittees. That is why in U.S. the
moment a budget is passed, ev-
ery legislator is given some
amount of money paid directly
to his account to run Commit-
tee duties.

What I am trying to say is
that the President of the Senate
should take a decision on behalf
of the Senate. Issues are always
put into a vote and if it is the
wish of the entire Senate, the ma-
jority always carries the vote and
he has no choice when the ma-
jority decides on where to go and
where to move. His duties are
to confirm what the majority’s
decision is. So what are you now
accusing him of?

Are you satisfied with the
current working relationship
between the Presidency and the
National Assembly?

Wait, 1 h-- o»“* finished what

~ying.

Go on, please.

looked at it. We want our
independence based on the
principle of separation of
powers. This separation of
power, does not, therefore,
mean that you will be
antagonistic to the executive.
And let me tell you, in the
United States of America, there
is an office meant for lobbying
where a Chief Lobbyist is
appointed between the executtve
and the legislative arms of
government. If by today in
Nigeria we have a Senate
President who combined a job
of a Chief Lobbyist for the
benefit of his colleagues in the
Senate and that, of the executive
what is wrong? Must we carry
arms before it would be known
that there is a need for separation
of powers? Politics is all about
negotiation, politics is all about
dialogue.

Don’t you think that it has
affected the image of the
National Assembly?

It does not affect. No, it does
not affect.

As a lobbyist and at the same
time, as a lawmaker?

In this case it is a different
issue. Let me tell you, we are
not performing as lobbyists to
satisfy the executive for the
legislator’s wetfare. It is to
establish a firm understanding
between executive and the
legislative arms and there is
nothing wrong in doing that. For
instance, if a Senator were able
to bring a project within his
Senatorial Districts and if the
National Assembly leadership
lobby the executive for the
implementation of such projects,
there is nothing wrong. The fact
that it is not going to be Waku’s
project or anybody’s project
doesn’t matter. It is the people
within these communities that
will benefit through an
individual's efforts. We are not
saying that we are rubber
stamps. And it has never
happened since he became the
Senate President. He has never
told the executive, “give me that
and I want to go and see my
colleagues.” It has never
happened. So what is the reason
for the attack. Everybody has
his own style of leadership.
During Enwerem, he brought us
the recognition. He brought
prestige. Prestige in the sense
that during the Second Repu ¥ ic
legislators took car loans. B t
during Ewerem he said no. Yo.
should not be provided with ca,
loans. You should be providec
with cars and when you ar
leaving you leave it with t' -
government of the day.

Secondly, during that S-.c-
ond Republic, not every le: «sla-
tor had an office. It is or.y the
principal officers. So, y u can
see what I am saying. T: day, al-
most every Senator h ¥an of-
fice.

And when Okadigbo came,
he tried to bring us independence
with his own leadership style
which was to stabilise the Na-
tional Assembly by creating
welfare. Indeed, some of the ac-
tions like the Senate Committee
work were initiated by Chuba
Okadigbo. ’

relative latecomer to the
Internet, Cuba has now
embarked on a major

technological modernisation
programme whose chief pro-
moter and enthusiast is President
Fidel Castro.

At a computer room in Ha-
vana University’s foreign lan-
guages department, students
wait patiently for slots, they
booked in advance to use one of
six machines connected to the
Internet.

One-by-one they consult
their e-mail or browse Web sites
under a sign that warns, among
other instructions on the use of
computers: “It is prohibited to
disseminate information not in
line with the principles of the
Revolution.”

Underpinning that is the use-
fulness of the Internet to what
Castro calls the “Battle of Ideas,”
his government’s year-old ideo-
logical offensive to demonstrate
the superiority of Cuban social-
ism over the Western capitalist
model.

“We have no fear of the dis-

tionary information on the
Internet beeause you cannot fear
lies, and all that is lies,” said
Melchor Gil, Vice Minister in
the Information and Communi-
cations Ministry set up last year
to oversee Cuba’s technological
drive.

“Those who should be wor-
ried are our enemies because the
Internet is the ideal medium for
disseminating the truth about
Cuba,” Gil added at a recent
news conference.

In that vein, official institu-
tions have created 300 Web sites
such as that of the Foreign Min-
istry (www.cubaminrex.cu),
which vigorously promotes
Cuba’s political aims abroad,
such as its fight against U.S. eco-
nomic sanctions.

Some foreign businessmen
are working in joint venture with
Cuba to help develop Internet
sites. “There is a desperate need

about Cuba,” said Stephen
Marshall, a British entrepreneur
who has 65 active Web sites
about Cuba, some in partnership
with Cuban companies.

According to Vice Minister
Gil, the state’s sites receive 50
million visits per month. “The
way to defend our principles is
to put our information out on the
Internet,” he said.

But only a small percentage
of Cuba’s 11 million people can

see these or other Web sites. Gil
acknowledged there are only
60,000 e-mail accounts on the
island, of which just “one quar-
ter have the ability to surf the
Internet.”

“I’m starting a course on
Web sites and I have never
surfed the Internet, not even for
one minute, I only have e-mail,”
said a graphic designer who —
like most Cubans when speak-
ing to foreign correspondents on
politically delicate subjects —
preferred to remain anonymous.

IBM launches quietest notebook drives

ig Blue last week
launched a new line of
Travelstar hard drives

for notebooks that the company
claims are the world’s quietest.
Among other sound-reduction
features, the new 48GB
Travelstar is fitted with sound-
dampening padding to reduce
excess vibration. New micro-
code also allows the arm of the
disk to travel more smoothly
over contours.

The disk’s platters also spin
on a bed of liquid rather than on
ball bearings.

“If you think of this as a lazy
Susan, what we are doing is re-
placing the lazy Susan with liq-
uid, which eliminates the metal
to metal noise,” said David Uriu,
Director of Marketing for 2.5-
inch disk drives at IBM.

Many of these individual
technologies have been featured
in other drives, but never in
combination together, Uriu

i, —s eS

added. Along with being quiet,
the drive spins at 5,400 rpm,
making it the fastest mobile hard
drive to date.

It’s alco the largest capacity
drive produced for notebooks,
capable of holding 48,000 nov-
els, or 12 DVD movies. One-
upmanship over disk speed and
size, however, is common in the
disk industry.

IBM has long positioned it-
self as the Cadillac of

technological innovations than

semiconductor division, for in-
stance, 1s known for state-of-the-
art innovations. It produced the
first chips in volume to use cop-
per wires, rather than aluminum.

The emphasis on technol-
ogy, to a certain degree, has
helped IBM stay competitive in

scheduled to begin this
month.

Palm’s revenue beat ana-
lyst forecasts by climbing to
$473.8m, up from $272.3m
the previous year and $522m
the previous three months.

Exports of Palm handheld
computers were 112 percent
higher this year compared to
the previous year, bringing
the total to 13 million de-
vices.

But despite the rise in
sales, profits were lower than
the previous year due to in-
creased competition in the
market, and the cost of devel-
oping new advanced prod-
ucts.

Net income during the
three months was down to
$9.3m compared to $15.8m
the previous year.

The announcement came
after the close of the US stock

Nine arrested over internet
child pornography

nited States authorities
have broken up an
internet child pornogra-

phy mafia based in Russia and
arrested nine people in a joint
operation with Moscow police.

An assistant U.S. CUS-
TOMS service Commissioner,
Dennis Murphy, told newsmen
that four Americans and five
Russians had been arrested fol-
lowing a year-long investigation
into the sale of explicit child
pornography videos over the
internet, mainly to Americans,
from a web site called “Blue
Orchid” run from a Moscow
apartment, recently.

Last week, US government
said they are conducting more
than 20 separate investigations
for child porn distribution and

eration Blue Orchid and officials
expects to make more arrests.

Acting U.S. Customs Com-
missioner, Charles Winwood,
said, “we have to send a mes-
sage: those who are using the
Internet this way cannot hide.”

Similarly, Russian police
made the first arrests in Decem-
ber when they took Sergey
Garbko and Vscvallod Solutsev-
Elbe into custody on suspicion
of operating the ‘Blue Orchid’
web site, the US Customs Ser-

in.

Rather, it supplies benchmark
software to vendors for a
membership fee. The vendors
run the tests in a best-case
environment and submit the
results to SPEC.

The SPEC’s key measure
of CPU performance is a
benchmark called CPU2000.
This test has two compo-
nents: CINT2000 and
CFP2000, so named because
they exercise the CPU’s in-

cuitry, respectively. Most of
a CPU’s workload involves
integer operations including
math (addition and subtrac-
tion), logic (and/or state-
ments), and memory manipu-
lation. CINT2000 muns a tar-
get CPU through a battery of
integer tests. The final
CINT2000 base result is a
single number that is essen-
tially meaningless, except in
comparison with other chips’
CINT2000 base results.

A quick visit to http://
www.spec.org/ is a good

place to start studying the
published results. But re-
member: Always avoid mak-
ing spending decisions based
solely on benchmarks, even
SPEC’s. No benchmark can
predict how well a CPU will
handle your workload.

: -udwig van Beethoven (1770-
1827), the second-oldest
child of the court musician

and tenor singer Johann van

Beethoven, was born in Bonn.

Ludwig’s father drilled him thor-

oughly with the ambition of show-

casing him as a child prodigy.

Ludwig gave his first public perfor-

mance as a pianist when he was

eight years old. At the age of eleven
he received. the necessary ‘system-
atic training in piano performance
and composition from Christian

Gottlob Neefe, organist and court

musician in Bonn. Employed as a

musician in Bonn court orchestra

since 1787, Beethoven was granted

a paid leave of absence in the early
part of 1787 to study in Vienna un-
der Mozart. He was soon compelled
to return to Bonn, however, and af-

Vienna as his new residence and
took lessons from Haydn,
Albrechtsberger, Schenck and
Salieri. By 1795 he had earned a
name for himself as a pianist of
great fantasy and verve, admired in
particular for his brilliant improvi-
sations. Before long he was travel-
ling in the circles of the nobility.
They offered Beethoven their pa-
tronage, and the composer dedi-
cated his works to them in return.

By 1809 his patrons provided him
with an annuity, which enabled him
to live as a freelance composer with-
out financial worries. Beethoven
was acutely interested in the devel-
opment of the piano. He kept close
contact with the leading piano
building firms in Vienna and Lon-
don and thus helped pave the way
for the modern concert grand piano.

Around the year 1798
Beethoven noticed that he was suf-

fering from a hearing disorder. He
withdrew into increasing seclusion
for the public and from his few
friends and was eventually left com-

] pletely

The final years in the life of the
restless bachelor (he changed living
quarters no fewer than fifty-two
times) were darkened by severe ill-
ness and by the struggle over the
guardianship of his nephew Karl,
upon whom he poured his solici-
tude, jealousy, expectations and
threats in an effort to shape the boy
according to his wishes. When the
most famous composer of the age
died, about thirty thousand mourn-
ers and curious onlookers were
present at the funeral procession on
March 27, 1827.

lobally, Jazz is regarded as
sophisticated elistist and
innovative music. But this

has not always been the situation
with Jazz music.

In fact this area of sophistry was
introduced to Jazz music in the late
1940’s with the advent of Bepop
and the rise in popularity of such
artistes like trumpeter Dizzy
Gillespie, alto/tenor saxophonist
Charlie “Bird” parker and other re-
formers who began to pursue inno-
vations and dexterity instead of con-
vention in the late 40s.

This trend was given more vent
in the 1950s by a number of artistes
like Miles Davis, pianist Bill Evans,
baritone saxophonist Gerry
Mulligan and the Dave Brubeck
Trio-all of whom were proponents
of “cool” jazz. That is a softer less
intricate rendition of the Bepop’
style.

JaZZ

Ostensibly the jazz of today was
greatly influenced by the 1950’s
situation where multifarious styles
were introduced into the music
form. For instance, artistes like
Herbie Hancock performed Hard
pop and later pioneered “avant
garde” Jazz.

These new sound formats obvi-
ously took jazz off the dance hall
and made it a property of matured
musical minds and the elite, thereby
restricting its mass appeal. In fact
other jazz formations of the late 60s,
afro beats for instance, had the ba-
sic aim of returning jazz to the
people from whence it came ulti-
mately, afro-beat failed to achieve
this.

Apparently, the music idiom
failed to spread widely as appeared

tightmated with the name of its in-
vestor, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, whose
contribution was that he fused main-
stream jazz with highlife music.

But as Paul Dairo disclosed to
me recently, Fela’s style of music
borrowed from Coltaine. Neverthe-
less, it was only after the death of
Fela that other proponents began to
try their hands on Afro beat.

However, jazz innovations have
no bounds as different parts of the
world try to give their own inter-
pretation of what largely an Afro-
American music form derived os-
tensibly as historical fusion of used
African and Engineer music.

The Jazz resurgence at the close
of the 70s was not as massive as
should have been expected . Re-
cently musicians have even tried to
play “crossover” jazz with steel in-
struments. And of recent, in the
1980s to be précise, Tedd Relly

(American pop producer) tried to
put jazz on the dance floor by in-
venting “New jack swing” But its
rap Music package, did not make a
lasting impression, even though it
held sway for some years.

Thanks to the Marsalis brothers,
the life of jazz has remained
unquenched.

What about Kenny G? You may
want to ask . With the plenteous
Grammies and platinum records the
man has won. There is no doubt that
his overly-pop jazz ruled the mu-
sic form in the 1990s, But then
Kenny G may be big, but jazz is no
longer in charge.

Gone, it seems were the days of
“traditional” jazz and “Dixie land-
jazz’ as played in New Orleans and
Chicago amplified by such great
names as Joe “King” Oliver, Louis
Dods and others, who ruled the
1929s’ dictatorially.

Gone also is the swing era or the
big band era of the 1930s and 40s
when clarinettist Benny Goodman,
Count Basic, Duke Elligton and
Jimmy Lunceford ruled the airways.

And the “Sweet Swing” era
when performers like Glenn Miller,
Wtyne King, Guy Comberdo and
others produced danceable and
popular jazz music that was the talk
of all and sundry.

Fact it was that even in the big
era, Pop music was not the only
thing, innovation was also re-
spected. But the appeal was mass
based unlike now that the music
appears to have come to an end for
the masses. Obviously, jazz players
have to listen to the great jazzman,
Duke Ellington to keep things in the
right perspective and remain rel-

ne day a poor old
Nightingale fell sick.
Within a few days, the

sickness got worse. He couldn’t
raise his wings to fly. And his
voice grew dull that whenever he
sang, some other birds laughed at
him mockingly. Very socn. his
children noticed how their father
was being mocked whenever he
sang. They felt worried that they
discussed anxiously. Later, they
made an idea of fighting against
those who acted in such a disre-
spectable manner.

Nightingale’s Legacy

Without their knowledge, all
they discussed and decided were
overheard by their sick father. In
an instant, he talked to them in his
dull, shaking voice.

“Don’t worry about what other
birds do to me. The world is de-
mure enough to retaliate for me.
All you have to do now is come
closer to me, I have a legacy for
you, said the poor old Nightin-
gale.

They inched closer and knelt
down attentively, to listen to him.

“T have been one of the popular

birds known with sweet voice. Now
that I have lost handsomeness I lost
my sweet voice and | lost strength
due to old age. The world has
beaten me” said the poor old night-
ingale. He sneezed and sighed and
then paused for a while, then con-
tinued talking to his nestlings. “Be
careful in this world. Do and try as
much as you can and make good
and better use of your life”. He
coughed and paused again for a
while and started talking, “my chil-
dren, make use of your wing, fly
and reach a land called remarkable

achievement, it’s the land of which
everyone wants to go and live in it.
Use your eyes and locate good
ways that will take you to the land.
Please make good use of your
sweet voice” he paused, panting
and then looked at them one after
the other and said, “for now, I’m
dying. Don’t be confused about
what I’m telling you, just comply.

The old and poor Nightingale
fell flat and sprawled, and then died
on the spot.

The nestlings broke into tears.

“father you should not die, we
love you to be with us” said the
younger nestlings sobbing.

“Father! Father! Can’t you hear
me, father!” said the second nest-
ling in his anxious voice.

“My brothers, my sisters. We
shouldn’t be foolish, he’s dead. He
can’t move, look or talk to us —
All we should do now ts bury him
and calf down with patience. Al-
lah would help us, his legacy
would guide us in our life, and our
hope and determination would help
us go to the land of total happi-
ness’, said the elder nestling in a
soft and confident voice.

title of New Nigerian for
the paper even before they set sail
from England to come to Kaduna
to set up the paper.

A. I don’t know about that. But
I do remember this dinner at Mr.
Sharp’s house and what transpired.”

Once the decision on the title of
the paper was taken other issues
were quickly resolved. At a Press
Conference held in Kaduna on !7’h
June, 1965, Mr. Sharp informed the
world that the new company, the
Northern Nigerian Newspapers
Ltd., was to start printing a daily
newspaper to be known as the New
Nigerian which was to absorb the
Nigerian Citizen before the end of
1965.

He also announced that
machinery worth over £90,000 for
the company had begun to arrive in
the company’s premises and were
in the process of being installed. (In
1997 money terms, this was about
N 11, 880,000.00).

“The machinery is among the
best in the world for producing first
class work and indeed it will be the
first of its kind in Nigeria,” Mr.
Sharp asserted. »

And true to his claims the New
Nigerian made its debut on Ist Janu-
ary, 1966- a beautiful newspaper,
technically well-produced with no
smudges which was characteristic
of all Nigerian newspapers being
published at that time. Even the
manufacturers of the press in Chi-
cago, U.S. of America were im-
pressed: “Congratulations. Print
quality as good as anything we have
seen come off one of our presses”

In its first editorial the New Ni-
gerian promised above all that it
would strive to be “a good news-
paper; dispensing news and com-
ment without fear or favor.”’

Secondly, it went on, ‘’as a
Northern newspaper we shall seek
to identify ourselves with the North
and its peoples, their interest and
their aspirations. For that we offer
no apology. But at the same time we
shall champion the vital need for
national unity, for without unity and
the first and mutual respect that
goes with it, this great country will
never find its rightful place in the
sun. “

Thirdly, the editorial, among
other things, promised to “honour
truth and try to instill within our
editorial staff a sense of purpose
and a pride in their profession.”

The editorial is worth publish-
ing in full: The Principles by which
we stand-or fall The New Nigerian
makes its bow in troubled times.

A few weeks ago a leading daily
pospager closed down

Another

faces a ban on sales m two regions
of the Federation.

For a time at least the bigots
have had their way.

Where stands the New Nigerian?
There are many things we shall
strive to achieve-but above all we
shall try to be a good newspaper,
dispensing news and comment
without fear or favour. -

As a Northern newspaper, we
shall seek to identify ourselves with
the North and its peoples, their in-
terests and aspirations. For that we
offer no apology. But at the same
time we shall champion the vital
need for national unity. For with-
out unity and the trust and mutual
respect that goes with it, this great
country will never find its rightful
place in the sun.

In the same way that we shall
oppose the evil extremes of tribal-
ism, so we shall raise our pen
against all forms of racialism and
discrimination. We shall honour
truth and try to instill within our edi-
torial staff, a sense of purpose and
a pride in their profession. We shail
welcome all shades of responsible
opinion, for we are conscious of the
fact that we represent the people as
a whole, and not just a section of it.

We shall try to show under-
standing towards all. We ask the
same and no more from the public.

Thus the principles by which we
stand are simple, but should truth
and justice be assailed by ignorance
and fear, or tolerance challenged by
prejudice, then they will become the
principles by which we shall fight
and, if necessary, fall.

Unfortunately, the New Nige-
rian only served its founders -
Sardauna’s Government -for just
two weeks. On [Sth January 1966,
the Army took Over the govern-
ments of Nigeria at Federal and re-
gional | evels and the Prime Minis-
ter of Nigeria, Alhaji Abubakar
Tafawa Balewa, the Premier of the
North, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, the
Sardauna of Sokoto, the Premier of
the West, Chief Ladoke Akintola,
were assassinated in the course of
the coup d’etat. Also eliminated
were all the senior army officers of
Northern Nigerian origin of rank of
Lt. Colonel and above except one,
Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon. Those
killed included Brigadier Zakariya
Maimalari, Lt. Col. J. Y. Pam, Col.
Kur Muhammed, Lt. Col. Abogo
Largema, Brigadier S. A.
Ademulegun and his wife and Colo-
nel R. A. Shodeinde. Thus as a par-
tisan “Northern” newspaper, the
was still born. A new Nigeria in-
deed emerged from the tragic events
of that Friday night, January 15th,
1966.

The Rast

The maiden edition of the New
Nigerian. in addition to its policy
editorial, carried profound messages
of goodwill from both the Gover-
nor of Northern Nigeria, Alhaji
Kashim Ibrahim and the Premier,
Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna
of Sokoto. In his message, Alhaji
Kashim lbrahim expressed the hope
that the New Nigerian would prove
“to be a cementing force to the unity
of Nigeria:

“With its size and great diver-
sity, Northern Nigeria has an excit-
ing and continuous story to tell, not
only to Northerners but to all Nige-
rians and indeed, all the world. In
the past we have had to face certain
obstacles in the effective telling of
our story. We have relied on friends
and the indulgence of others to tell
our story.

Today, we join the field with the
New Nigerian, which 1 hope will
prove a worthy competition not only
to our own press in Nigeria but to
the foreign newspapers which we
read in this country. I hope that in
telling the story of the North and this
Federation, the New Nigerian will
maintain the highest of professional
standard.

And may be, young as it is, bring
some freshness and purpose to jour-
nalism in our Federation. It is my
earnest hope, above ail, that this
newspaper will prove a cementing
force to the unity of Nigeria”

In his message, the Sardauna of
Sokoto stressed that the
newspaper’s greatest weapon for
success of its mission is “I hope the
New Nigerian. will rely at all times
on this reliable weapon: tell the truth
about the North to the world and in
return tell us the truth about the rest
of the world”.

The Premier’s message was
thoughtful and penetrative. It
touched on the essence of the news-
paper so eloquently that it deserves
to be quoted in full.

“It gives me great pleasure to
welcome the birth of this daily
hewspaper in the North today.

When one pauses to reflect on
the recent history of our growing
country, one cannot but come to the
conclusion that a newspaper of this
nature in this Region is a very ‘real
necessity. It used to be generally
considered as being improper for
one to blow one’s own trumpet. But
the fact has emerged and has been
demonstrated time and again that
nowadays if you do not blow your
own trumpet, nobody will blow it
for you-for the simple reason that
they are too busy blowing theirs! ,

I am of course, not saying that
the New Nigerian should be a trum-
pet-blowing newspaper as such.

The New Nigerian 1s born!

In the last account we‘read about how the title ‘New Nigerian’ was selected. In today’s account the story unfolds to reveal the
early days of the New Nigerian, and the Sardauna’s warm and encouraging words at the inception of the paper.

What I am saying is that such a
newspaper is necessary to tell the
world, in words and pictures, the
exciting story of Northern Nigeria
as it unfolds day by day.

| have repeatedly expressed my
desire that this region should be
publicised far and wide. We must
tell our fellow-countrymen about
ourselves; we must tell the outside
world about ourselves. We have not
been entirely without our own re-
sources for doing this, but this news-
paper will add considerably to our
effectiveness in a sphere in which
we have been rather weak.

I hope that once again the New
Nigerian will demonstrate a fact that
Northern Nigeria has demonstrated
several times in the past -namely,
that while we do K6t believe in rush-
ing wildly into new schemes just for
the costly glory of being labelled
‘first’, we do believe that once we
have made up our mind that some-
thing is desirable, necessary and
possible, we go all out to do it well.

We do not believe in reckless
haste to get things done; if we did,
this newspaper, or something like
it, could have been launched long
before now. But it would not be the
same as the newspaper that is
launched today, because the long
and careful thought, planning and
preparation that has gone into the
New Nigerian would have been
lacking.

There are several other newspa-
pers in this country today and all of
them can claim to be older than the
New Nigerian: this circumstance, to
my mind. should work tn favour of
this newspaper because what is re-
quired on the present day scene is a
completely new angle to things, a
fresh and vigorous approach to our
problems and aspirations.

The New Nigerian is new and it
is fresh: it is not weighed down by
age; nor encumbered by old preju-
dices: it has no ancient policies to
preach and no lost causes to fight
for at all costs. I have no doubt that
it will look at events with unclouded
eyes and report these events faith-
fully. This is the real need today and
I believe the newspaper is best
suited to fill it.

“It should tell the world in
words and pictures, the leading
story of Northern Nigeria as it un-
folds day by day.”

The region has in the past been
a frequent victim of prejudice,
distortion and downright falsehood
on the part of certgin organs in th
newspaper world. I hope this
newspaper will not make the
mistake of descending to such levels
against anybody, anywhere. The
greatest weapon is truth

Bishop beats wife to coma | [in sien: NYSC staff in court

he Bishop of a Pen-

cated on Ogbor Hill,

Aba in Abia State (name

wife to death recently over
an alleged sexual abuse of
their housemaid by the man
of God.

According to sources, the
house girl was lured into a
room by the Bishop, who
tore her clothes when the girl
refused both his advances
and the N1,500 he allegedly
offered her. A source said
that when the wife of the
Bishop, an Igbo newscaster
with the NTA, Channel B,
Aba, came back from work,
she saw their housemaid in
the care of their neighbours.

Confirming the incident,
the wife expressed regret that
the maid was not the first vic-

Bishop but all other house-

jecting one of its tenants
ml to be occupying a make-
uift Structure within the
mises of the union at its
tedquarters in Area 11,

| Senior Magistrate, Mrs.
ace Inyang issued the or-
Fo restraint in Abuja last

® plaintiff, Barrister
Ramin Enemaku.
‘According to the lawyer,
—_——

the NUJ had threatened to
use force to evict one of their
tenants at its Area 11 head-
quarters premises, Abuja.

The counsel to the plain-
tiff submitted that there was
a receipt for a two-year rent
payment made to the union
which will expire next
month.

He urged the court to re-
strain the union or its agents
from carrying out the ejec-

truth of the matter.

Investigations revealed
that the pastor was alleged
to have impregnated a

woman who was once his
housemaid and aided the
abortion of the pregnancy in
1998 while in another occa-
sion he impregnated a
woman in his church.
Efforts to get the Bishop
proved abortive, as he has
reportedly absconded from
his matrimonial home as
well as from the church.

one Ogundele Gbenga in
court for causing death
through dangerous driving.
The accused person said
to be a staff of the National

The accused person
pleaded not guilty while his
counsel, Mr. Faith
Ahwinawhi prayed the court
for bail adding that Gbenga
has been on police bail since
the incident occurred on
March 19, 2001.

The prosecution did not

object to the application but
told the court that the case
file has been forwarded to

ecution (DPP), for necessary
advice.

(ACG) of Customs,

Mr. Alexander Dedeke, has
appeared before the judicial
commission of inquiry into
NITEL and M-Tel on the
auctioning of three 800 K VA
generators belonging to
NITEL.

Dedeke, who was also
the Chairman, Ministerial
Committee on the disposal
of abandoned goods at the
Ports, said “the containers
carrying the generators were
not bearing NITEL’s name.”

He told the Commission
that it was later through the
manifest of the Nigerian
Ports Authority, that the
Committee knew that the
generators belonged to
NITEL.

The ACG explained that
the goods belonging to gov-
emment organisations were
exempted from disposal.

According to him, efforts
have been intensified to re-

cover the generators, al-
though they had been auc-

tioned at the cost of

N200.000 each.
Meanwhile, the chair-

man of the Commission,

Justice Daniel Adeniyi, has
adjourned further hearing on
the matter to April 4 this
year.

her life and her marmniage.
The victim (name with-
held), a middle-aged woman
had brought a complaint to
the Commission, alleging
that ever since her husband
took a second wife, he had
tumed her into a punching
bag and has refused to
discharge both his sexual
and financial responsibili-
ties to her.
She said she then opened
a food canteen but her “‘jeal-
ous” husband chased away
all the male customers.

When she went into supply
of sand to building contrac-
tors, her husband accused
her of sleeping with them.
He then beat her, knocked off
her tooth, and banned her
from coming into her matri-
monial home where she has
several children.

Frustrated, the complain-
ant turned to the Commis-
sion for help. When an In-
vestigator contacted the al-
leged violator, the man ac-
cepted beating his wife but
accused her of adultery cit-
ing an instance where his
wife was said to have obeyed
an “Alter Call” in church
when the Pastor invited all
adulterers to come out for

special prayers.

A meeting set up be-
tween the Commission’s of-
ficers and the couple led to

a resolution of the crisis.
The woman moved back into
her home and the husband

fixed her tooth.

Rector wants better deal

for

he Rector of the Fed ~
eral Polytechnic, Bida,
Niger State, Engineer

Umar Sani-Ango, has called
for the immediate implemen-
tation of the Adamu Yabani
Committee on the future of
Polytechnics in Nigeria.

Engineer Sani-Ango
made this call in his welcome
address to the meeting of
Council of Heads of
Polytechnics and Colleges of
Technology (COHEADS) in
Bida at the weekend.

The rector pointed out
that the implementation of
the Yabani recommendations
would make it possible for the
polytechnic system to de-
velop and attract high-calibre
personnel.

“There must be a scheme
whereby retiring rectors can
be efficiently attracted to re-
main within the system, as
the universities
do, Engineer Sani-Ango
said.

He also urged the Federal

impression in the eyes of
society that polytechnics are
inferior to universities.

“I believe that if the rec-
ommendations of the Adamu
Yabani Committee on the fu-
ture of polytechnics are imple-
mented, we would have taken
a significant step towards
this, as well as the general
improvement of polytechnic
education in this
country, Engineer Sani-
Ango stated.

He disclosed that the Fed-
eral Polytechnic, Bida, had in
its 24 years of existence main-
tained its academic standards
as a centre of excellence for
the 17 National Diploma and
22 Higher National Diploma
programmes accredited for it
to offer by the National Board
for Technical Education
(NTBE).

The courses, he said are
mostly in the fields of engi-
neering, applied sciences,
environmental and manage-
ment studies.

The rector enjoined the
heads of the nation’s poly-
technics to “extensively de-
liberate and come up with far-
reaching resolutions on
problems affecting the tech-

nics

nological advancement of
this country in line with the
new world order which inte-
grates telecommunications
with the use of technology.”

Niger state governor, En-
gineer Abdulkadir Kure, in
his address said his govern-
ment had put in place
measures to enhance the
teaching and learning of
science and technology.

He said his administration
had designated some
schools solely for science
and technical studies.

“This 1s aimed at enabling
the state to fill its quota in
institutions of higher
learning,” he averred.

Governor Kure, who was
represented at the occasion
by his commissioner for edu-
cation, Alhaji Abubakar
Daja, acknowledged the as-
sistance of the Educational
Tax Fund (ETF) in its
educational programmes.

“The future of Nigeria lies
in polytechnic education
whose graduates should be
job creators rather than job
seakers,” Kure said.

He, however, cautioned
polytechnic teachers on the
danger of incessant strikes
that unnecessarily elongate
students’ stay in school.

Federal civil service may be re-structured

he Federal Civil Serv

tured if the Federal!

Government accepts pro-
posal to split the Department
of Finance and Supplies/Ad-
ministration into separate
departments.

Sources in the Presidency
said at the weekend in Abuja
that the Office of the
Accountant-General of the
Federation (AGF), has
proposed to government the
splitting of the Finance and
Supplies/Administration
Department.

The sources said that if
the proposal is accepted by
government, a new Finance

Department would t ¢ created
to be headed by >2fficers
drawn from the Offi e of the
Accountant-Genera of the
federation.

It was learnt that th>
Supplies and Administration
Department, also to be
created from the separation,
would, however, be headed
by career administrative
officers.

Sources said that the ini-
tiative is not new to the ser-
vice, noting that a similar sug-
gestion had been earlier
made to the Federal
Government by _ the
Accountant General’s Office
during the tenure of Alhaji

Gidado Idris as Secretary to
the Federal Government and
Head of Service.
According to the
sources, the suggestion was
rejected by the then govern-
ment because it was not con-
vinced by the arguments
advanced by the office of the
accountant general in
support of the move.

he Catholic Arch
bishop of Abuja,
Most Rev. Dr. John

Onaiyekan, has warned gov-
ernment-owned media
houses against succumbing
to excessive control, as their
services would be treated as
garbage, fit only for trash
cans, if they became mere
propaganda outlets.

“Nigerians might be poor,
powerless and helpless, but
not fools,” Onaiyekan said at
a service organised in Abuja
to mark the 50" anniversary
of the Federal Radio
Corporation of Nigeria,
(FRCN).

Onaiyekan, who remarked
that the media houses owed
their allegiance more to the
people with whose tax were
being financed, said that the
FRCN management must re-
sist the temptation of using
its network to sing praises
and boost personal egos of
people in power.

The Bishop, who is also
the Vice President of the
Christian Association of Ni-
geria (CAN), urged the pub-

Don’t succumb to
excessive control

—Bishop warns Govt-owned media

lic media to “listen to the
people, interpret their moods
and convey exactly that to
government without fear or
favour.”

He further admonished
them not to feel scared of tell-
ing government what the
people thought of their ac-
tions, saying that they would
be doing government a dis-
service if they hid the truth
as government would con-
tinue to wallow in self -deceit
until things went out of con-
trol.

The Bishop particularly
challenged the media to en-
sure government was in-
formed of the public’s reac-
tion to bad policies “like the
deregulation of the oil sector
currently being considered
by the government.”

The cleric particularly
urged the media to lead the

current war agains
corruption, stating that they
should expose the socia!
malaise in all its facets ne
matter whose ox was gored.

Onaiyekan observed that
there was no way the wa.
against corruption, could
succeed without an effective
media, stressing that the
public could not trust their
leaders for information in that
regard as they were those on
whom the searchlights were
being beamed.

He lamented that the
hope for a better Nigeria since
independence had remained
in the doldrums, but alerted
that even the “suspended
hope” Nigerians still maintain
for their nation would soon
fizzle out if nothing was done
to better the plight of the or-
dinary man.

The associations, which
spoke through the IPMAN
state chairman, Alhaji Awwal
Rimi Mai Shadda, cautioned
the Federal Government to
wade into the matter before
it degenerated into a national
disaster.

He noted that their asso-
ciations will not fold their
arms and watch their mem-
bers killed or maimed and
their wealth destroyed with-
out compensation.

The associations ex-
pressed concern over the
abuse of human rights of
other citizens, saying “we are
not afraid of anybody. We
shall retaliate with utmost
speed and violence to any
unprovoked attacks aimed at
disestablishing our legitimate
business in any part of this
country.”

They also regretted that

country, over 1000 trucks and
their members’ property

worth millions of naira were

destroyed.

From Austin Odo,

Friday.

Olayinka who lived in
Mando village, a Kaduna
suburb, was reported to have
“lost control of himself” in
the swimming pool, but
could not be rescued imme-
diately, till he drowned.

Although the hotel
authorities are claiming ig-
norance, investigations by
Daily Trust revealed that
after noticing that Olayinka
had died, some workers
initially took the body to the
hotel’s clinic, and later, the
Barau Dikko Specialist
Hospital where morgue
attendants could not accept
the body due to the bad state
of their facilities.

“They brought the body
here around 4:00 p.m., and I
told them our mortuary is not
in a shape to take in any
corpse now, so I advised
them to go to the 44 reference

hospital mortuary,” a morgue
attendant told Daily Trust at
the Barau Dikko Hospital. It
was later confirmed that
Olayinka’s body was depos-
ited at the 44 hospital mortu-
ary.

Our investigations fur-
ther revealed that one Timo-
thy Ato, a Hamdala hotel staff
reported the incident to the
police who were preparing
the autopsy report in readi-
ness for burial before the
deceased’s father intercepted
It.

“I don’t see any need for
all these, the cause of death
is clear, there is nothing Siny-
one can do now. | just want
to go and bury my son peace-
fully. I have no reason to
make a case,” the father was
reported to have told the po-
lice, who confirmed the inci-
dent, saying they prepared
legal papers from a magistrate
court to enable them release
the corpse to Mr. Salako.

More than 48 hours after
the incidents however, the
hotel’s public relations of-
ficer, Hafsatu Lawal, told
Daily Trust that neither she
nor any management staff
was aware of the incident,
even as other employees
confirmed it. Efforts to see
the hotels’ manager proved
futile as his hostile secretary
said he was not prepared to
comment on it.

This is the second of such
mysterious deaths in the ho-
tel in the last 12 months after
a similar incident on October
1, last yéar. Customers who
spoke to Daily. Trust at the
swimming poo] expressed
serious concern that myste-
rious deaths such as these
are likely to affect their fur-
ther patronage. Just as the
hotel’s business is just
picking up after the religious
crisis in Kaduna last year
which greatly affected the
patronage of hotels in the
state.

Bayern v United: The

Karl signs record deal for coaches

eorge Karl became
the highest-paid
coach in profes-

sional sports and a part-
owner of the Milwaukee
Bucks.

Terms weren’t revealed,

but a source with knowledge”

of the deal who spoke on con-
dition of anonymity said the
two-year extension is worth
$14 million and also includes
a small slice — believed to be
1 to 2 percent — of the fran-
chise that is valued at $125
million.

Karl, who turns 50 in
May, is committed to the
Bucks through the 2003-04
season.

“George is one of the best
coaches in the game and this
extension ensures that we will
continue to have his leader-
ship on our sideline for the
next several seasons,” gen-
eral manager Ernie Grunfeld
said Wednesday. “He’s inno-
vative, he’s a great motiva-
tor and he has a genuine pas-
sion for basketball. Those
qualities make him a great fit
for this team and this city.”

Karl is in the third year of
his original four-year, $20
million contract. The exten-
sion makes Karl the only
coach, other than Miami’s Pat

Basketball

Riley, to own stock in his
team, said Karl’s agent, Bret
Adams.

The deal contains escape
clauses that would allow Karl
to leave if the Bucks win the
NBA title after next season or
the job at Karl’s alma mater,
North Carolina, comes open
again. Kohl didn’t allow Karl
to interview for the Tar
Heels’ job last year.

Karl wanted to wait until
the summer to sign his
record-breaking contract ex-
tension so that it didn’t de-
tract from the Bucks’ bid for
their first Central Division
crown since 1986.

But the delay actually led
to speculation he was hold-
ing out for another job, so
Adams and Bucks owner
Herb Kohl worked out the
details of the deal this week.

The timetable was moved
up because of rumors Karl
was waiting for Mike
Dunleavy to be fired in Port-
land so he could take the Trail
Blazers’ job.

Karl once worked for
Portland general manager
Bob Whitsitt in Seattle.

“My thought all year long
was it would be better served
if we signed it in the summer-
time,” Karl said. “But I think
because of all the stuff that’s

Karl.. the highest paid coach in professional sports.

been stirred up, it’s probably
best signed (now).”

The Bucks have enjoyed
a turnaround under Karl,
reaching the NBA playoffs in
his first two seasons, and they
are approaching their first
Central Division title in 15
years.

“George’s leadership and
his passion for winning have

had a very positive effect on
the Milwaukee Bucks and on
the entire community,” Kohl
said. “His basketball knowl-
edge and his competitive
spirit have helped restore our
winning tradition. At the
same time, his work ethic, his
accessibility and his genuine
love for the game have en-
deared him to our fans.”

Del Bosque honoured by contract extension

eal Madrid,CF head
coach Vicente Del
osque has said he is

honoured by the club’s
decision to extend his
contract until June 2003.
“It gives me great satisfaction
that they have put their trust
in me while we are in the
middle of the season with two
titles still to play for,” Del
Bosque admitted.

The mild-mannered Real
coach said negotiations with
the club’s sporting director
Jorge Valdano had been con-
cluded without a hitch.
"The negotiations were very
straightforward. The only
condition I made was that I
wanted to continue with the
same team of coaches that I
have at present.”

Del Bosque, who is
Real’s eleventh coach in the
past ten seasons, said the de-

cision to extend his contract
was a reflection of the club’s
desire to avoid the uncer-
tainty of previous years.
“It is important that your
work is valued and that the
club functions in a stable en-
vironment,” he said.

Real’s players greeted the
news that Del Bosque was
staying as coach with enthu-
siasm. “I am really pleased,”
Brazilian international
Roberto Carlos said. “He
never seeks the limelight but
the fact that things are going
so well this season is down

Spanish international
striker Raul Gonzalez also
praised a man who has been
involved with the club for
over 30 years. “He is a great
coach who has always tried
to create a comfortable atmo-
sphere in which the team can
work effectively,” he said.

With typical modesty,
Del Bosque said he was
grateful for the players’ sup-
port. “I don’t know if it is
good to have the players
speaking so well of a coach
but, in any case, I would

rather have them with me
than against me.”

Del Bosque, replaced
John Toshack as Real coach
in November 1999 and led
the club to their eighth Euro-
pean Champion Clubs’ Cup
victory last season. He will
become the longest-serving
Real coach in the last 25 years
if he sees out his contract.
Real lead the Spanish first
division by five points with
11 matches remaining and
are playing Turkish club

French Connection

- Willy Sagnol

hen Willy Sagnol
signed for FC
Bayern Minchen

for .6.4m from AS Monaco
FC last summer he became
only the third Frenchman to
join the German champions,
after Jean-Pierre Papin
(1994-96) and Bixente
Lizarazu. In his first full sea-
son Sagnol has established
himself in the nght-back role
vacated by Markus Babbel,
and his recent performances
for Bayern have been good
enough for him to win his
second cap for France, ironi-
cally enough versus Ger-
many in Paris last month.

The 24-year-old learned
his trade at the football acad-
emy of AS Saint-Etienne,
whose senior team he
captained at the age of 19.
Having played for the
French under-18 and under-
21 teams, Sagnol made his
debut for the French national
team in November last year
in the 4-0 win over Turkey.
At Monaco he came under
the influence of Claude Puel,
who converted him from a
midfield player to a full-
back.

“Sagnol is a role model
for any professional football
player,’ says his former
coach. “He takes very good
care of his body and during
his time with us he was never
injured. For a right-back he
is very technically skilled
and at Bayern he will no
doubt improve his strengths
in man-to-man marking.”

Sagnol usually plays
right-back, with World Cup
winner Lizarazu — his own
role model and the other half
of what Bayern fans call the
“French Connection” - on
the left. But Sagnol himself
says his long-term ambition
is to move into central de-
fence.

Sagnol himself is still
somewhat in awe of his new
surroundings in Bavaria: “In
Monaco we practically knew
the name of all our support-

ers because we only had
about 4.000 people watching
our home matches,” he says.
“But in Bayern this is all dif-
ferent and the support behind
the club from the fans is tre-
mendous. We are like one
big family, everyone sticks
together and my goal is to
become a regular in the team
here. It’s very unusual that
French players move to Ger-
many, but I feel very at home
in Munich.”

His new coach, Ottmar
Hitzfeld, says: “Sagnol is
very technically strong but
he needs to develop more at-
tacking initiatives into his
game. This was also
Lizarazu’s problem when he
arrived here and look how
much he has developed. In
modern football defenders
have to be very versatile but
I have to say that I am very
impressed with the way
Willy has developed in man-
to-man situations. He never
lets anybody get past him.”
On the pitch Sagnol is dy-
namic, aggressive and very
competitive but by his team-
mates he is described as very
quiet, calm and even a little
reserved. He is, however, a
big Formula One buff and
his thoughts lie not only in
Europe but further afield in
Japan and Korea.

Toyota chasing

apanese giant Toyota,
Ji latest major manu-

facturer to enter For-
mula 1, are reportedly pre-
paring to lure Michael
Schumacher away from
Ferrari when his contract ex-
pires at the end of next year.

Responding to a story in
German newspaper Bild
linking the world champion
with Toyota, Schumacher’s
manager Willy Weber said:
“Nothing is impossible.”

He added: “As a general
rule we must take everything
into consideration.

“Ferrari has top priority
however because Michael
feels good at Maranello and
his dream of a Ferrari era
appears about to be realised.”

Weber also said he was
unconcerned about the fact
that Schumacher’s contract,
which expires at the end of
2002, has not been renewed.
“There’s no hurry,” he said.

“‘We’ ll discuss it towards the

However, in the article

have Schumacher in their

aris Saint Germain
pP (PSG) midfielder,

Austin Okocha who
was given the last chance to
prave his relevance in the
Super Eagles in the
forthcoming friendly match
against Libya has turned
down the invitation.
Okocha’s reasons were
not quite plain except he
adduced serious club
engagements. But this is
ironical in view of the fact
that Okocha hardly feature in
PSG’s matches and when he
does merely as a substitute.
Apart from Okocha,
Tijjani Babangida and Garba
Lawal are equally turning
down Johannes Bonfrere’s
nod to enlisted them in the
Eagles squad to confront
Libya in Tripoli on April 7.

The duo’s decision not to
honour the invitation is in
protest against the NFA’s
inability to make refunds of
their return tickets each time
they and other members of
the Eagles fly in for national
service.

Lawal, the Roda FC left
winger, described as
“outrageous” the NFA
insistence not to pay more
than 2,500 dollars, an amount
said to be for the economy
class. But Lawal, who served
notice in Ethiopia that
himself and other Eagles
might be forced to ignore
future invitations, said no
fewer than 3,500 dollars is the
amount they usually pay to
make any round trip to
honour national invitation.

However, four other
players are backing out of the
Tripoli friendly match for
different reasons. Ifeanyi
Udeze, who is fastly

position from out-of-form
Celestine Babayaro, returnee
Emeka Ifejiagwa, Julius
Aghahowa and _§ Isaac
Okoronkwo who played
brilliantly in Chingola,
Zambia in a Nations Cup
qualifier, are all opting out for
club engagements.
Ifeyiagwa, Udeze and
Okoronkwo were said to

have pleaded with Bonfrere
to excused them in the Tripoli
friendly, even as they vowed
to be available for the April
21 make or mar World Cup
qualifier against the Leone
Stars of Sierra Leone.

While Patrick Ovie and
Yakubu Aiyegbeni who
feature for Ironi Shoni Lezion
and Maccabi Haifa will also
miss the Tripoli friendly

because they play in Israel.
The Libyan authorities have
directed the NFA that
players with Israeli clubs
should be excluded because
of diplomatic and political
face-off between the two
countries.

Bonfrere though is yet to
make replacements for them.
The tentative departure date
for the team is April 4 while
the friendly holds on April 7.

Why youth football’s
faltering, by Ekarika

ormer Flying Eagles
H striker, Uwem Ekarika,

has attributed
Nigeria’s dwindling fortunes
in youth soccer to lack of well
articulated graduated
programme and inadequate
pre-tournament
preparations.

Ekarika observed that a
progressive programme
would have ensured that
players from the previous U-
17 teams stepped into the U-
20 squad as obtainable in
other countries.

He regretted that such
graduated programmes was
lacking in Nigeria, a situation
that compelled assemblage of
fresh players each time the
country has an age-grade
engagement. He cited the
example of the present Black
Satellites of Ghana which
graduated from the Black
Starlets U-17 side that
defeated the Golden Eaglets
in 1999.

Members of the then
Eagiets graduated into the
Flying Eagles squad that

By Patrick Andrew

performed woefully in the
African Youth Championship
in Ethiopia. The authority it
appears has neither given
serious consideration to a
graduated programme nor is
it willing to learn from the
examples of other countries.”

The sweat merchant of
Akwa United FC, an amateur
league shield aspirant, said
the usual epileptic and fire
brigade approach was
another bane of Nigeria’s
poor outings in the age-grade
championships.

Ekarika, whose team
thrashed host Industrial
Promoters of Abuja 2-0,
noted that it would be
difficult for Nigeria to win any
laurel in youth soccer unless
the necessary things were
done. He insisted that gone
were the days when the NFA
could just assemble a crop of
players without requisite
experience to participate
meaningfully in any age
grade championship.

The former Flying Eagles
striker said the authority
administering football in the
country must evolve a
functional programme that
would allow for and facilitate
the development of a youth
programme.

“We cannot continue to
rely on the fire brigade
approach. The time has come
for Nigeria to adopt to the
scientific approach to
preparation for competitions.
The technical department of
the NFA should be up and
doing in fashioning out
functional youth
programmes.”

Mark Aku, T7rustsports
learnt, had by fiat ordered
the NFA to reverse the
decision of the organizing
and disciplinary committee
against Plateau United
whose fans were indicted
for encroaching on the field
of play during the
rescheduled week 13
encounter in Jos.

The encroachment
abruptly terminated the
encounter. Though the
Plateau United were leading
by 3-2, the visiting El-
Kanemi protested and the
NFA organizing and
disciplinary committee
found Plateau United guilty,
with match officials report
strongly indicting them.

Consequently, the
committee banished
Plateau United to Makurdi
and awarded the three
points at stake to the E]-
Kanemi Warriors, a
development the officials of
the Tin City club found
hard to stomach and
decided to seek ministerial
intervention.

Aku, we __ learnt,
subsequently ordered the
NFA to reverse the decision
by returning Plateau United
to Jos as well as restoring
he three points to them,

But the authorities of
the Glass House are
chafing over the directives,
as its implementation would
set an undue and damaging
precedence.

An impeccable source
disclosed that it may even
create unnecessary
avenues for clubs to
capitalize on flaunting pro-
league laws.

The NFA 1s hard put as
to how to implement the
ministerial fiat without
provoking untoward
reactions inviting clubs to
disregard the decisions of

Trustsports learnt that
the Plateau United
management has appealed
against the committee’s
decision thus giving the
NFA the needed vista to
execute the ministerial fiat.

But the El-Kanemi
Warriors are not letting
things lie low. The club’s
management has officially
intimated the Borno State
government of the
development, a situation
that might pitch Plateau and
Borno States on each
other’s throat.

Trustsports recalled that
erstwhile sports minister,
Damishi Sango, had by fiat
ordered the NFA to award
three points to Plateau
United against Gabros
International last
season,which ensured
Gabros inability to play in

the Super Four
Tournament.
Plateau United fans had

also last year physically
assaulted Jigawa Golden
Stars players openly,
without recourse for
discipline. In all, the team
went scot-free.

he Vice Chancellor of
the Benue State
University, in

Makurdi, Prof. David Ker,
has advised university
authorities to strictly monitor
the academic programmes of
their satellite campuses to
avoid cheapening their
degrees and certificates.

Prof. Ker, who spoke to
journalists in Makurdi on
Friday, regretted that the
satellite campuses had been
abused. He said that although
Nigerians needed education,
they should not obtain it at
all costs as if it were a do or
die affair.

“In some of the satellite
campuses, students are
taught by unqualified lectur-
ers.” The vice chancellor ob-
served, adding that this was
detrimental to the image of
the nation’s institutions and
that most of the graduates

would not be proud of their
certificates.

Prof. Ker supported the
guidelines laid down by the
Federal Government for in-
stitutions wishing to run sat-
ellite campuses, saying that
it would bring sanity into the
academic programmes.

He told NAN that the

ate on the matter after con-
sidering the reports of the
high-powered implementa-
tion committee and that of
the technical committee of
the project, in order to enable
the government to finally
award the contract by that
month.

The minister disclosed
that the Department of Na-
tional Civil Registration
(DNCR) had embarked on a
massive rehabilitation of its
facilities, offices and centres
nationwide, in readiness for
the take-off of the project.

Shata said that the DNCR
in collaboration with INEC
and the National Population
Commission (NPC), was
making concerted efforts to
ensure a smooth implemen-
tation of the “much awaited”
national ID.

“The implementation

programme has effectively
taken-off. A detailed
workplan of the implemen-
tation has been produced by
the technical committee and
its tender analysis sub-com-
mittee to guide the collabo-
rative programme of the
project,” he stressed.

He also expressed the de-
termination of the Federal
Government to ensure the
quick and successful imple-
mentation of the project, not-
ing that the present adminis-
tration had demonstrated its
“unequivocal” commitment
by giving its political will
and financial muscle to the
scheme.

According to him, “we
have reviewed the project
and decided to complete it
within the shortest time pos-
sible through a programme
of collaboration between
DNCR, INEC and NPC.”

Shata reiterated the deci-
sion of the government to use
the identity cards to identify
voters at polling stations dur-
ing future elections in the
country as well as for demo-
graphic purpose.

EDITORIAL
ECOWAS’ Ivan
the Terrible

he rampaging sabre of Charles Ghankay Taylor of

; Liberia appeared to have been caged in its scabbard

when in 1997, the rebel leader transformed into the

democratically elected President with the support of

ECOWAS. Not a few heaved a sigh of relief. With hundreds

of West African troops sacrificed, peace was finally brought
to that war-ravaged country.

Five years after, it has become regrettably clear that Tay-
lor, far from being caged, has exported his immense capacity
to brew and relish crisis to other countries in the sub-re-
gion.

Rather than rebuild his war-ravaged country as he prom-
ised Liberians during his campaigns, Charles Taylor has
instead chosen to recreate West Africa in his own image.

At home, the Liberian economy still remains in tatters —
electricity is such a luxury that our NEPA will be revered in
Liberia. Unemployment is about 70 percent. Ex-combatants
in the 1989-1996 civil war still roam the streets and are
responsible for the ever-increasing crime rate in the coun-
try.

National reconciliation has not fared any better as Tay-
lor has prepared the hemlock of treason for his political
opponents, Alhaji Kromah and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf and
other rival politicians have been hounded out of the country.

Not satisfied with his havoc at home, Taylor has expanded
his sphere of evil influence to Sierra Leone and Guinea. It is
no longer news that Liberia, under Charles Taylor, has been
the bedrock and mentor of the Sierra Leone’s Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), the rebel force that unleashed an orgy of
hair-raising amputations and decapitations on their fellow
Sierra Leoneans, the bestiality of which is unprecedented in
the history of West Africa. The democratically elected gov-
ernment of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah has forever been running
from pillar to post to contend with this genie called Taylor,
while the latter relishes in the wealth he makes from arm-
ing the rebels in exchange for diamonds.

No sooner had ECOWAS, on November 10, 2000, negoti-
ated a ceasefire in Abuja between the RUF rebels and Sierra
Leonean government than Charles Taylor extended his pen-
chant to destabilise other countries to Guinea. Taylor had
allegedly vowed never to forgive Guinea for contributing
troops to ECOMOG. His incursion into Guinea has provoked
a refugee crisis, the scale of which the United Nations’ High
Commission for Refuges described as the worst human trag-
edy in modern history.

In spite of all these, ECOWAS countries have continued
to explore peaceful means to improve the relations among
member-countries and promote peaceful co-existence in the
sub-region.

In 1998, President Taylor requested for ECOMOG troops
along his country’s border with Guinea. The request was
granted. Last year, he promised to turn over a new leaf de-
scribing the Guinean President, Lansana Conte as his “great
African brother”.

When other West Africa countries came to Abuja to par-
ticipate in the inauguration of the ECOWAS Community
Parliament, a body that would further enhance peaceful co-
existence in the sub-region, Liberian delegation refused to
show up. Again, when a delegation of ECOWAS set up to
explore the possibility of resolving the differences amongst
the countries of Mano River Union, Liberia declared the am-
bassadors of Sierra Leone and Guinea persona non grata
and gave them seven days to leave Liberia. This action, no
doubt, nipped the efforts of ECOWAS in the bud.

Is it not ironical that it was at the request of ECOWAS
member-countries that the United Nations’ Security Coun-
cil tonned down the regime of sanctions which it imposed on
Liberia by delaying its commencement by two months?

Certainly, West African countries have had enough of
the wiles and guiles of Charles Taylor and it is high time

they allowed him to stew in his own juice by allowing free

Fuel shortage and deregulation

By: Aminu Iyawa |

he problem of fuel shortage in this country has

reached fever-pitch in the last few months. At least,

we have not had it so bad here in Kaduna since the
advent of our nascent democracy. And going by the re-
ports from other parts of the nation, the situation is the
same everywhere.

Fuel shortage-anywhere at all, results in hardships for
the people. Because without the movement of vehicles,
not only does economic activity stop, but life itself is put
on hold. Everything we eat, sell or buy has to be trans-
ported from somewhere; the seaport, the city, the village
or the farm.

While fuel shortages in the south started only a few
years ago, the phenomenon is not particularly new to the
people on this side of the Niger, who have been suffering
since 1986 when the then military government, in its ef-
fort to meet the demands of the IMF/World Bank,
through’ the Structural Adjustment Programme SAP, in-
creased the pump price of petrol from 15 kobo to 39
kobo and diesel from 11 kobo to 29 kobo. It was in the
wake of the anticipated increase at the time, that buying
fuel became a nightmare for the poor majority.

As both the government and the labour have drawn
the battle-line, it is increasingly becoming clearer who will
have the upper hand at the end of the day. Never before in
the history of this country has a leadership insisted on the
implementation of an “unpopular” policy, with such stri-
dent arrogance and will-power. Not even the (mock) pro-
tests staged by the Nigeria Labour Congress throughout
last week have deterred the government from its, inten-
tion of deregulating the downstream sector of the oil in-
dustry.

At many fora, President Olusegun Obasanjo has reit-
erated that “there was no going back on the plan”. Vice
President Atiku Abubakar has been even bolder in his ap-
proach. He told journalists over the weekend that the NLC
membership constitutes less than one per cent of the
country’s population and cannot, therefore, claim to be
representing the people. This berating, if anything, casts
doubts on the labour union’s ability to stop the govern-
ment in its drive on the issue.

For many Nigerians, however, the problem is not pay-
ing more at the pump stations, but rather, having the com-
modity constantly available. Because since the 1986 in-
crease when hoarding and smuggling became a gold mine,
filling stations have become conduits for the perpetrators
who become instant millionaires. Although the construc-
tion of a standard filling station is estimated to cost not
less N5 million, new ones are springing up daily through-
out the country, even in odd places.

According to Vice President Atiku Abubakar, the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), is the
major culprit in the crises, accusing it of “not proffering
solutions, but rather, always positioning itself to benefit
from the suffering of Nigerians.

To this, I say: hail to the chief. At least, half of the
problem is now solved, going by the adage that says: the
solution to a problem is realizing the existence of the prob-
lem in the first place. Therefore, as premature as it may

seem, deregulation is not just the best answer, as far as 1
can see, but the only solution to this perennial situation
that defies everything else.

The government should, however, expect the worst
from these gold-diggers whom it wants to dislodge, as
they are a mafia who would go to any length to see that
they match strategy with strategy, to protect their invest-
ments.

For instance, there are currently over 7000 estimated
trucks that are involved in the lifting of the three popular
commodities: PMS, AGO and DPK- Petrol, Diese! and
kerosine in the layman’s language. The question, there-
fore, is: what becomes of all these trucks, if and when
the supply of fuel becomes normal? I raise this question
because, even the most “tokumbo” of these 33 thou-
sand-litre trucks cost nothing less than N2 million. And
since the crisis begun about 14 years ago, bridging and
smuggling were the two factors that kept the business
booming.

Bridging from the south to the north currently fetches
around N150,000 while smuggling fetches N1 million or
more depending upon luck. What is at stake here for the
perpetrators is: with the availability of fuel after deregula-
tion, there will be no more bridging as the PPMC pipe-
line network to the various depots will start functioning.
The trucks can only do local lifting which fetches not
more than N8000.00

Would these truckers and their owners be contented
with N8000.00 naira per day, and may be, twice a week
depending on their luck? And if the pricing becomes right,
and at par with our neighbouringcountries, there will also
be no more smuggling. Would they, therefore, just sit tight
and wait for another opportunity?

Converting the tanker-trucks to open-body would also
not yield anything as they are already saturated, particu-
larly with most industries operating below capacity, while
the jumbo contracts, that used to come from fertilizer
companies are no more, because production has stopped.

These are vital questions that need answers. For un-
less these people are rehabilitated, they can be a nuisance
in the face of the whole exercise. It is easier to deal with
those on the NNPC payroll who have been conniving with
them. They can be booted, axed, retired, transferred, but
what do you do with a veteran smuggler, who after a
single deal, can afford a new bride or any kind of tokumbo

an oversea’s trip? Any psychologist can tell you that they ;

would not let go easily.
Not letting-go easy had been the reason why the crisis

was sustained. For all these years that the people have .

been suffering, fuel has always been available outside the
city limits. You can drive from Port Harcourt to Katsi.4
and Yola to Yelwa in Kebbi State; the black market supply
has never dried. Yet we blindly kept on attributing the
scarcity to inadequate supply.

The challenge before Nigerians now, is that we are
faced with choosing between two evils: one; support the
deregulation and pay more, or two; support the statuesqu
that perpetuates hardships and still pay more at the black
market. I would certainly cast my vote for the former.
But on condition that the government goes about the de-
regulation as recommended by the report of the Special
Committee on the Review of Petroleum Products Supply
and Distribution.

Both the majority and the minority reports agreed on
the fact that any increase in the price of petroleum prod-
ucts should be gradual. That in essence would give Nige-
rians time to settle. Because most civil servants are yet to
fully enjoy their new salary structue, as they are owed
months in arrears, while the rest of the population battles
with poverty.

The administration should not, therefore, allow the In-
ternational Monetary Fund (IMF), to push it too hard on
this sensitive issue. Because should the wall collapse, the
victims will be the government and its people.

Igbo: A race without a vision?
| By Aminu Mohammed |

The retum to democracy in May, 1999, was a good omen for the
Igbo who have now constituted the opposition in Nigeria.

Talk about marginalisation, Igbos would say nba! If you men-
tion abandonment, the Igbos would say they are. Poverty is for
the Igbos, lack of basic amenities like portable water, good roads
and constant or near constant electricity supply are eluding so-
cial needs in Igboland.

All these, are good enough to set the Igboman on opposi-
tion. But while Nigerians sympathise with the plight of the
Igboman, how determined is he to set a mission with a vision for
his freedom from bondage?

Agreed that there was a black phenomenon in Nigerian his-
tory between 1967-70, when Igbos felt they were brave enough
to fight Nigeria by declaring the State of Biafra, which is today
responsible for all their woes. ThesIgboman’s miscalculation
pushed him into his present dilemma and it appears 30 years
after the civil war, this tribe called Igbo is yet to learn from his-
tory.

Agreed that democracy is to offer every individual the best
things in life, but when people begin to abuse democracy, it be-
comes something different. Recent comments by some Igbo lead-
ers call for attention and analysis and if left unchecked, these
comments may lead to yet another anarchy.

After the 1967-70 civil war, there were reconciliation, reha-
bilitation and reconstruction which were basically meant to heal
the wounds of the ugly war but, recent happenings appear to be
opening old wounds which may not augur well for the future of
democracy in Nigeria.

The Igbos, who felt brave, energetic and enthusiastic to form
a nation called Biafra complained of marginalisation, ethnic-
cleansing and, most annoying, segregation in the Nigerian army
and then went to war.

But then, 30 years after the ill-fated war, the Igbos are at it
again. Having used all other avenues and failed, they now want
to blackmail Nigeria with another gimmick claiming that the
2003 Presidency is a must for the Igboman.

Agreed, no Igboman has ever been duly elected as a presi-
dent, but Nigerian history would be fair to the Igbos by men-
tioning Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and General Aguiyi Ironsi as two
Igbomen who presided over the affairs of the country.

Recent comments by Governor Orji Uzor Kalu of Abia and
other Igbo leaders are comments that should not be casually dis-
missed with a wave of the hand. Kalu, for instance, the Bakassi
governor, is going too far not only on the president, but the en-
tire nation. His media comments are no longer comments from a
radical, but a man preparing for a bloodbath. Apart from his per-
sonal war with his party and his President, the Abia governor is
gradually tasking the patience of Nigerians.

It is very unfortunate that those regarded as leaders are not
as responsible as the clectorate thought in 1999. For now, the
Igbo leaders are discrediting themselves in the eyes of the ordi-
nary Igboman who ts keenly watching their utterances and steps

On the issue of the 2003 Presidential elections, the Igbo seem
to be divided on what they actually want. While some of the
South-East governors like Chimaroke Nnamani of Enugu and
Clement Nbadinuju of Anambra are clamouring for a second
term for Obasanjo, the likes of Kalu are foreseeing bloodbath if]
Obasanjo is re-elected.

After the first Igbo summgit in Enugu, it took the Igbos months
before they could come out with a communiqué which, in the
end, lacked substance. The communique was a far cry from the
agitations of people like Kalu. It is surprising that ranting Igbos
would fail to come out with a formidable voice that would seem
like a well tailored agenda

For now, what the Igbos need is a vision either for the future
of the ordinary Igboman or an agenda for their political future.
The race for the 2003 is far from going to the South east for the
future of Nigeria cannot be mortgaged to a confused race that
loudly barks, but lacks the power to bite.

This writer is not, how 2ver, anti-Igbo, but a sympathiser who
is tired of their “nomadic nrostitution in the affairs of this coun-
try. The Igboman is reso .rceful and purposeful but, for lack of
good leadership, he has become a beautiful bride without a groom.
The call for an Igbo President, come 2003 can only be possible
if their leaders learn to be committed, dedicated and courageous,

Igbo leaders like Alex Ekwueme, Emeka Ojukwu, Emeka
Anyaoku, Uzor Kalu, Ojo Maduekwe, Nnamani and their likes
should reposition their agenda to conform with the wishes of the
ordinary Igboman.

There is need for one voice, one cause and one mission in
Igboland and unless the Igbo leaders identify their problems and
tackle them within, they would continue to play the second fiddle,
not because of their civil war criminal act, but because they lack
a mission and a vision of purpose.

The Obasanjo administration is not the problem of the Igbo
race, but it is historical. The Igboman’s problem began when he

unity of the [gboman.

People like Kalu and Maduckwe should think of how to re-
write the Igbo history- for the present Igboman is the product of
a people without leaders. That is why they cannot produce a
presidential candidate come 2003.

Any attempt by the Igbo leaders to use Bakassi Boys or the
Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra
(MASSOB) to cause political anarchy or unrest would be re-
sisted by Nigenans as they did 30 years ago.

Already, the former Senate President, Dr. Chuba Okadigbo,
has warned the Federal Government to handle the MASSOB
issue with scriousness and caution. Well, as an Igbo leader, there
is no smoke without fire.

It is better for the Igbos to learn from history for the Biafran

of the 21 century Igbo rebellion would be very, very devastat-
ing.

NEPA in Chains

Dele Giwa, who cried out in

a masterpiece that the press
was in chains. He listed a
number of reasons to support
and validate his observation
then.

In this piece, the postula-
tion, which is supported by
facts, is that the much-criticized
and much-blamed National
Electric Power Authority
(NEPA), is a big organisation
with great potentials, but it is
chained.

The chains that manacled
the press which Dele Giwa
made an issue of, were laws
passed by the government.

In the case of NEPA, the
chain was forged and put to-
gether by the people, that is,
Nigerians, for whom the
organisation was created. In
other words, NEPA is a service
organisation,.whose area of
specialisation is the steady gen-
eration and distribution of
power to the public at a reason-
able fee. But people impede the
work of NEPA, only for the
same people to turn around and
blame NEPA for inefficiency or
failure to serve them propcrly.

The impediments forced on
NEPA by Nigerians include re-
fusal by power consumers to
settle their bills as and when
presented. In foreign countries
where power supply is constant,
something we yearn for in Ni-
geria, the consumers pay their
bills or get disconnected and
prosecuted. If NEPA is not paid
for services it rendered, it can-
not pay its suppliers such as the
Nigerian Gas Company, for ser-
vices rendered to it in the pro-
cess of generating transmitting
and distributing power to us.

It is routine for the media
to report cases of heinous
vandalisation of NEPA facili-
ties by sundry criminals. NEPA

I: was the late journalist, Mr.

[By Salisu Na’inna Dambatta|

transformers are an easy prey.
NEPA cables are fair game to
Nigerian criminals. This is de-
spite the 21 years or life jail-
term the offence attracts. There
is no public utility, possibly ex-
cepting the NNPC, that suffers
more vandalisation of its essen-
tial facilities than NEPA in this
country. Kilometres of NEPA
cables are stolen, its poles bro-
ken and transformers removed.
This heavy part of the chain
forced on NEPA affects its per-
formance negatively to our na-
tional disadvantage.

In big cities, in medium
towns, in villages and hamlets
across the country where NEPA
services are available, illegal
tapping of its product, electric-
ity, is common. People simply
hook up for free, either from a
neighbour’s residence or di-
rectly from the near-by power
lines. Some peopie take pride
in this form of theft and this
problem is part of the chain,
which is crippling the ability of
NEPA to serve us optimally. In
fact, it is probably only in Ni-
geria that this problem is en-
demic. Sadly, it is mostly the
people who are engaged in this
unwholesome act that use the
most foul language on NEPA
whenever there is load-shed-
ding or an interruption in power
supply.

The desire to cut corners by
some suppliers or importers of
sub-standard cables from the
Far East does not help NEPA.
Sub-standard cables wired in
residences or factories can lead
to fire outbreaks and negatively
affect NEPA installations in a
neighbourhood. This is part of
the chain that ties NEPA down.

If it is true that importers of
power generating plants sabo-
tage NEPA simply to have mar-

kets for their imported plants,
government would be right to
regulate power plant imports
and punish those guilty of the
alleged sabotage in the national
interest.

Quack technicians consti-
tute a portion of the chain that
affects NEPA negatively. They
tamper with NEPA facilities,
often causing power interrup-
tions and losses to NEPA. Yet,
Nigerians engage them, though
sadly, some quacks get electro-
cuted occasionally.

States and local govern-
ments want to electrify towns
and villages. They by-pass the
Rural Electricity Boards
(REBs). They tap power from
NEPA grid. Largely, the
projects are designed and ex-
ecuted without involving NEPA
until it is time to link the new
system to the national grid. In
cities, huge housing estates,
power-guzzling factories and
cottage industries are started
without involving NEPA from
the beginning. The local trans-
former is over-stretched and if
it fails to cope with the demand
forced on it, NEPA is blamed.

In addition to the chains put
on the legs and neck of NEPA
by some Nigerians, most con-
sumers of electric power do not
appreciate the influence of na-
ture on power supply in this
country. As the dry season sets
in every year, the rivers that
feed dams with water for gen-
erating hydro-power dry up.
With less water, the ability to
generate hydropower is re-
duced. Besides, storms and
floods can destroy NEPA instal-
lations. When this happens,
power Is interrupted and NEPA
gets the blame.

As an organisation man-
aged by human beings, there
could be inadequacies and self-
inflicted difficulties within

NEPA. For instance, a number
of NEPA staff have been found
guilty of committing misdeeds in
the past. Some of the misdeeds
impeded the ability of NEPA to
satisfy all of its consumers.

Given all the problems fac-
ing NEPA, it is the view of some
Nigerians that it should be un-
derstood, appreciated and
praised for its ability to survive
the odds ranged against it. Con-
sumers should, understand the
problems NEPA is coping with
and blame it less for shortcom-
ings forced on it by the actions
of some citizens as indicated in
parts of this piece.

Successive governments
have taken several and varied
measures to support NEPA. Pan-
els and commissions have
looked into the problems of
NEPA. Financial and managerial
support have been provided to
the authority. President
Obasanjo felt so strongly about
NEPA and its problems that he
brought it under his direct super-
vision. The Buhari administra-
tion promulgated a decree that
made vandalisation of NEPA,
NITEL and water supply instal-
lations a capital offence.

In addition to the massive
financial support given to NEPA
to achieve and sustain a
minimum of 4,000 megawatts
power generation by December
2001, some Nigerians are
suggesting that special courts be
created to try people who engage
in acts that are capable of
impeding the ability of NEPA to
serve us well. Some security
consciows Nigerians believe that
it is only when adequate security
measures to protect NEPA
installations from vandalisation
are put in place that a large chunk
of the chain on NEPA’s legs
could be broken.

Reflections on the Islamic financial system

s the world continues to
promote globalisation
nd an interest-based

capitalist system which has
resulted in the rich getting
richer and the poor getting
poorer, the case for an interest
free financial economy is even
more compelling.

The damaging effect of
riba (interest) permeates all
facets of life from government
economies, businesses down to
families and individuals. It has
adverse effects on production
and allocation of resources as
well as on distribution of
wealth. In Third World
countries, we can clearly see
the crippling effects of interest-
based loans. Poor countries
borrow money to pay off their
mounting public sector debts;
economies have become
stagnant and unproductive....
The list is endless.

Developed countries are
not excluded from the evil
effects of interest — they also
face national and foreign debts;
consumers borrow and make
purchases against their future
earnings; the credit system
encourages indebtedness
leading to bankruptcy etc.

A good example of a
conventional economy reeling
from the effects of interest is
Japan. Until recently Japan
used to apply an unprecedented
zero interest rate policy,
however, since it changed its
policy to an interest rate
economy, stock prices have
fallen and uncertainty has

mounted in recent weeks over
the durability of Japan’s
economic recovery. Japanese
banks are facing a mountain of
debts and profits have declined
or remained in the red as the
sector faces problems stemming
from a fragile economy, weak
stock market and poor loan
quality. Pressure is currently
building for the Bank of Japan
to return to the zero rate policy.

In advanced economies
there is a gradual move towards
non-interest based transactions.
The benefits and _ the
profitability of an interest free
system is being recognised. We
are now seeing the mergers of
conventional banks with
Islamic banks, many
conventional banks are now
offering Islamic financial
services and Islamic investment
funds are widely available in
Europe and the United States.
This development has been
acknowledged by Abdullah
Saif, Bahrain’s Finance and
National Economy Minister
“The intellectual, ethical and
innovative strengths of Islamic
finance have enabled Islamic
financial institutions to gain
momentum in an international
movement which has become
increasingly aware of the
possibilities of conducting
financial activities in
conformity with the principles
of the Shariah.”

With the advancement of
the Islamic banking system, it
is crucial that.ap international.

Shariah board is established for
the purpose of codifying the
guidelines and standards of the
operations and transactions
offered by Islamic banks and
financial institutions as laid
down in the Holy Qur’an. The
efforts of the Accounting
Organisation for Islamic
Financial Insti-tutions, Bahrain,
in the codification of a uniform
set of accounting rules for
Islamic financial institutions
should be applauded. The very
important role that the Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) plays
In giving financial assistance to
Muslim member countries,
which is largely free from
conditions unlike those
imposed by IMF, the World
Bank and other international
financing agencies should be
applauded, as should the IDB’s
contribution to the cause of
promoting active economic and
trade cooperation among_ its
members. Further, the roles of
Bahrain and Malaysia as
innovators in the development
of the Islamic financial system
should be acknowledged,
particularly in the setting up of
an Islamic money market to
help alleviate the liquidity
shortage currently faced by
Islamic banks and financial
institutions.

Oil rich Muslim countries,
including Saudi Arabia should
lead the way in supporting the
Islamic financial system,
patronising Islamic banks and
encouraging the growth of the
system. As Muslims weall have

a collective duty to play in
ensuring the success of a truly
Shariah compliant financial
system. Patronage of these
banks instead of conventional
banks is a step forward in the
right direction, in addition,
honesty and sincerity in our
dealings with one another will
give confidence to and boost the
growth of the system.

This new Islamic year,
should be a time for reflection
for Muslims. A time to reflect
and to take more seriously the
prohibition of riba (interest) by
Almighty Allah and the re-
sulting damaging effect that it
has and will continue to have on
societies. It is a time for radical
changes, time for an overhaul
of our system and time to move
forward and put into action
ways in which we can improve
the Islamic financial system and
provide purely Islamic financial
services to Muslims and non-
Muslims. Transactions of
interest cannot be allowgd to
continue forever on the bags of
necessity. It is time for Islamic
countries to put aside their
personal interests and approve
licenses for the establishment of
wholly Islamic banks and their
financial systems interest. It is
time for us to Support the efforts
of individuals and organisations
that are committed and offer
constructive criticism in the
promotion of this equity and
value based system.

he report of the Special
Committee on the Re-
view of Petroleum
products Supply and
Distibution is commendable
and comprehensive enough
to give an insight into the
problems of petroleum sup-
ply and distribution in Nige-
ria.

The main report and that
of the minority submitted by
the labour representatives are
virtually saying that the same
thing except that of the mi-
nority (whom I suppose rep-
resents those who are directly
affected, in the sense that
they pay for these products
or services directly from their
pockets) which is saying that
you should first put right the
“mess” in the sector before
you proceed to do anything.
I am, therefore, in complete
agreement with the labour
report.

Common sense dictates
that you cannot get maxi-
mum benefit (both the gov-
ernment and the governed)
from today’s ‘mess’ that is,

The report is commendable but....

the NNPC and its products
and, therefore, for a success-
ful deregulation and “appro-
priate pricing to be of ben-
efit, you must deal with the
following state of our refin-
eries: Low capacity, gross
mismanagement, excessive
unit operating cost, bloated
overheads, poor product dis-
tribution arrangements, low
productivity, sabotage, inad-
equate technology input for
necessary product and pro-
cess upgrade, management
that has all along been self-
serving instead of nation
serving (take a look at all the
management staff of the
whole set up they benefit
more in person than the na-
tion).

Until these factors are
properly addressed, we can
never be sure of the follow-
ing:

-Efficiency and profit
level of the sector.

-Profitable cost of refin-
ing a barrel of crude oil that

the government determine
the true level of subsidy.

-Level playing field in the
sector to attract the private
sector.

-The real motive of
vandalisation (is it political
arising from bad governance
or mere joining the band of
wagon of eating the national
cake)?

As soon as these issues
are addressed, government
should then proceed to cre-
ate a social engineering mea-
sure of creating a buffer from
the unpredictability of the
market rule. Government
should also come up with a
social security net, a regime
of anti- trust law, a consumer
energy supply, efficient tele-
communication services etc.

With these in place, then,
there will be little disagree-
ment about deregulation. It
must be noted that the prob-
lem of petroleum sector goes
beyond lack of deregulation.
It is compounded by corrup-
tion, greed, and mafia-reign
and elite interests. Deregula-

tion will not make them dis-
appear; neither will it elimi-
nate smuggling and massive
sales and distribution fraud
that are the hallmarks of the
system.

We must not forget that
we have had this question of
deregulation and increase in
price five times in nine years.
How long shall we continue
getting it wrong? We must
also remember that the ques-
tion of deregulation of 1998
failed because it was not ac-
companied by self-adjusting
price mechanism.

Incidentally, what does
the government actually want
in deregulation? Is it effi-
ciency, supply, availability,
cheaper prices, empower-
ment of the private sector or
just joining the chorus? Can
all these noise be merely a
policy thrust? Until the citi-
zenry understand all these, I
am afraid government can
not be trusted with the suc-
cess of the new one being
promoted!

ermit me a space in
your paper to respond
to the comment made

by the Kano State Butcher’s
Association’s legal secretary,
Dr. Haladu magaji, in his in-
terview in one of the Weekly
Newspapers, over the state
government’s intention to re-
locate Kano Abattoir to
Kwanar Dawakin interna-
tional cattle market.

In that interview, Dr.
Haladu described the move
as unjustifiable, not minding
the fact that the market and
the new abattoir are meant for
the development and

progress of the people. And
if I may ask, what does
Haladu know about human
rights? I wonder what type
of human rights he was re-
ferring to when he said that,
the insistence of the state
government on the reloca-
tion of the abattoir to Kwanor
Dawakin international cattle
market was an infringement
upon “THEIR” fundamental
human right.

The establishment of this
unique market and the new
ultra-modern abattoir, will,
no doubt, go along way in
creating jobs for the people.

Dr. Haladu went further
to say that it was undemo-

to even think of taking such
a step. Since Dr. Haladu, a
Ph.D. holder could not un-
derstand the full meaning of

he goes back to school to ac-
quire some knowledge of
democracy. I can’t under-
stand how a democratic gov-
ernment which operates
within the constitution of the
land can be said to be doing
something undemocratic.

Perhaps it was because of
his failure to secure an ap-

paign of calumny against the

Jbasanjo in thieves’ den

t beats my imagination
[os President Olusegun

Obasanjo does not bat an
eye -lid over the series of sto-
nies of fraud perpetrated by
his close aides or associates
carried by newspapers on a
regular basis.

Sometimes, I begin to
feel that the newspapers are
really wasting their time and
scanty, resources carrying
out these investigations on
matters concerning the
fraudulent acts of Obasanjo’s
aides when it is quite obvi-
ous that the President will
definitely turn a deaf ear to
such stories.

The consequences of
what Obasanjo’s seeming
oversight portends, cannot
be over emphasized. Apart
from the fact that it can make
a mess of the anti-corruption
crusade, it also poses a ready
point-of-reference to all
those who believe that Presi-
dent Obasanjo’s probe on the
late Gen. Abacha’s family is
a mere vindictive measure to
avenge the treatment meted
out to him during the late
Abacha’ s reign.

The 7ribune newspaper

story of 14th January, 2001,
captioned “Presidency aide
buys £20 million house”, is
endlessly a waiting reaction
from the right quarters. Two
months after the story hit
town, the presidency has not
reacted.

It is, thus, unbelievable
that government has not
deemed it fit to refute this
story or carry out an investi-
gation into the matter.

_ The whopping sum in-
volved in this scandalous
story is such that would have
drawn the attention of any se-
rious-minded administration,
least of all one that is claim-
ing to be an anti-corruption
crusader.

From all indications, the
impression that is created by
President Obasanjo’s anti-
corruption crusade is that, un-
less you are his enemy, no
qualms. Little wonder, the
late Gen. Abacha’ s family
are the only Nigerians being
probed for alleged financial
crimes. It is really regrettable!

our excellency, the
issue now in your
country is your

government’s plan to
confiscate five million
hectares of land out of
about 12 million hectares

from white farmers for redistribution to
blacks. Why did it take Britain some 20 years
after independence to think of this policy?
Thank you very much. The issue of
historical background come$ in. There were
commitments that were made in 1979 at the
Lancaster House Conference. The main
problem now is what I call the unfinished
business of the Lancaster House Conference
because Great Bnitain, at that conference, made
an undertaking that they were going to
provide money, 75 million pounds, to pay for
the compensation of the land that was going
to be given for resettlement because the
Zimbabwean Patriotic Front, the liberation
movement, argued that Zimbabweans should
not buy land that was taken from indigenous
people by force by the colonialists. Britain
made that undertaking. And the United States
also made an undertaking that they were going
to provide $520 million to compensate the
farmers for the land that was going to be used
for resettlement purpose. By 1997, the new

that the conditionalities coming along the way
and accusing government of not resettling
properly....We are talking about 500 farmers
at that time who owned 15 million hectares of
the fertile land. At that time we were talking
about 10 million indigenous people who did
not get land.

We understand that the white farmers
under the auspices of Commercial Farmers
Union have changed their attitude to the
government’s position. They have been meet-
ing although there is this division whether to
tow the line of government or not. What pro-

“What the Commonwealth can do is to send
a mission to Great Britain to persuade them
to honour what they promised.”

Labour government in the United Kingdom
reneged on that commitment as agreed at the
Lancaster House. In addition, the Lancaster
House constitution under which Zimbabwean
got her independence has certain clauses that
forbade government from taking over land to
distribute to the landless majority because it
was a willing buyer, willing seller
(arrangement) which means government is to
raise money in order to pay compensation.

But did the agreement give the British
government a specific time frame to fulfill
that condition?

The agreement was an undertaking. It is
said of an English man that his word is his
honour. So it was taken as such. It was taken
in good faith and there were a lot of other
witnesses to that but subsequently you find

posals have they really come up with?

We do not know the content of their pro-
posal. They are yet to divulge them to the
government but government is consistent that
we must solve the land problem once and for
all.

That is why a constitutional amendment
was passed in 2000 which apportions the re-
sponsibility compensation to the former co-
lonial power, the Great Britain. And this gave
(the government) the night to appropriate land
for resettlement. But this is done in a very
systematic way by (giving them) the nght to
appeal if they think that their farms are desig-
nated wrongly.

Most of that has to do with one derelict
farm, farms owned by overseas landlords and
farms that are not utilized--multi farms. There

are people who have four, five farms
of 8,000 hectares each, which
means about 16,000 football fields
(to) one person when the average

Zimbabwe the average farm is 3000 Sengwe
hectares...So you can imagine the dispropor-
tion. And all the statistics that we have, it is
only 10 per cent of the farms that are being
utilized when the majority of the people are
languishing in marginal lands.

Now your country feels very strongly
about the plans by the Commonwealth to send
a fact-finding team to your country. What is
wrong in the team coming to your country?

I believe the Honourable Minis-
ter of Foreign Affairs has made it very clear .
We do not have any problem with CMAG
(Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group) or
the Common wealth. The problem is between
Great Britain, a former Colonial power and
Zimbabwe over the question of paying com-
pensation; honouring the commitment they
made at the Lancaster House conference.
They reneged on that issue. Now it is the
question of addressing that issue, the ques-
tion of dialoguing with Great Bntain.

What the Commonwealth can do is to
send a mission to Great Britain to persuade
them to honour what they promised in 1979.
That is the issue... They are raising the issue
of good governance and the rule of law. Yet
the real issue is land distribution to address
the imbalance in order to make sure that
people have something to eat. They have a
right to their land which was alienated from
them by force.

The land issue is the
main issue but some have
brought up other issues
like the outcome of the
recent election, the op-
position party, the
judges’ case and things
like that and the fact find-
ing mission is con-
cerned with these other
issues. What do you have
to say to that?

All those issues are
an obfuscation. The real
issue is the question of
land. They are trying to
tag in other issues. The
election came and went.
The opposition has 56
seats.

They just lost one
seat during a bye-elec-
tion. Ours is a truly demo-
cratic country. We have
had five elections since
independence.

The question of the
judge was a question

that was dealt with by the
government... Zimba-

bwe is not the first place where people dis-
cuss their own issue in their own house. They
are domestic issues, internal affairs of a mem-
ber state that the Commonwealth has no nght
to intervene because CMAG or the Harare
Principle has addressed the question of mili-
tary coup. In Zimbabwe, there was an elec-
tion, there is a parliament and the parliament
is functioning.

If somebody wants to create a problem in
order to hide their responsibility on the ques-
tion of land, nowhere in the world do we have
a farm of 3,000 hectares belonging to one per-
son. Even inGreat Britain, it is not there. If the
question of poverty is not addressed, then
there is a problem...

Let us discuss your country’s involve-
ment in the Congo. Rwanda and Uganda
claimed they had withdrawn their forces
from the DRC but Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia are still there. Isn’t it time to pull
out to make way for a peaceful resolution of|
the crisis?

This issue was addressed by His Excel-
lency when he was here during his state visit
last year in which he explained very clearly
that Zimbabwe has no territorial ambitions.

Zimbabwe went there in the context of
the SADC (Souther African Development
Community) allied forces just like you have
ECOMOG and in ECOMOG, was itall the coun-
tries that were participating? ... The SADC took
a decision and Zimbabwe is part of SADC al-
lied forces. The government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo invited SADC allied forces.
The same government has emphasised when
those that were invited would leave. Presi-
dent Kabila has mentioned that if the invad=
ers leave, then the SADC forces will leave.

Talking about Nigerian Zimbabwean re-
lations, it appears Nigeria is the only one
spending, having supported your country fi-
nancially in your liberation struggle. What
has Nigeria benefitted from your country?

It is a mutual relationship. Your president
talked about African cooperation and integra=
tion where business persons from Nigena will
go to Zimbabwe and do business and vice
versa...We have a delegation moving back and
forth discussing how we can move forward in
the context of A fmrcan integration.

What of the joint-commission between NE
geria and Zimbabwe?

We have it. Arrangements have been
worked out to convene that commission... To
uS, Our primary purpose here is to ensure that
there is effective relation between Zimbabwe
and Nigeria in the spint of African coopera-
tion and integaration and we are working for
that, in particular, the question of land where
we want to see the issue addressed im ear-
nest...
